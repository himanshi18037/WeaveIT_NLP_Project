## Project Description
WeaveIT - We explore the different methods of performing autocompletion in two languages: Hindi and English and also experiment with a mixed corpora.

## Data Exploration 
We construct our own dataset. The dataset consists of two components: English and Hindi text. The English data was taken from 1661-0.txt which is an eBook of 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' penned by 'Arthur Conan Doyle'. The Hindi data was taken from 'premchand.tsv' which consists of 157 short stories and 10 novels by the Indian writer Munshi Premchand. 
## Baseline Models
The Baselines Codes for autocompletion models are in this directory.
