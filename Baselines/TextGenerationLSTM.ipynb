scandal in bohemia\\n\\n\\ni.\\n\\nto sherlock holmes she is always _the_ woman. i have seldom heard him\\nmention her under any other name. in his eyes she eclipses and\\npredominates the whole of her sex. it was not that he felt any emotion\\nakin to love for irene adler. all emotions, and that one particularly,\\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. he\\nwas, i take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\\nfalse position. he never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\nand a sneer. they were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\\ndrawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. but for the trained\\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results. grit in a sensitive\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. and\\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late irene\\nadler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\n\\ni had seen little of holmes lately. my marriage had drifted us away\\nfrom each other. my own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\\nwhile holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian\\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in baker street, buried among his old\\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\\nnature. he was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\\nfrom time to time i heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\nsummons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder, of his clearing up\\nof the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee, and\\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of holland. beyond these signs of\\nhis activity, however, which i merely shared with all the readers of\\nthe daily press, i knew little of my former friend and companion.\\n\\none night—it was on the twentieth of march, 1888—i was returning from a\\njourney to a patient (for i had now returned to civil practice), when\\nmy way led me through baker street. as i passed the well-remembered\\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\\nwith the dark incidents of the study in scarlet, i was seized with a\\nkeen desire to see holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\\nextraordinary powers. his rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as i\\nlooked up, i saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\nagainst the blind. he was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. to me, who\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\\nstory. he was at work again. he had risen out of his drug-created\\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. i rang the bell\\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\\n\\nhis manner was not effusive. it seldom was; but he was glad, i think,\\nto see me. with hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. then he stood before the fire\\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\n\\n“wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “i think, watson, that you have put\\non seven and a half pounds since i saw you.”\\n\\n“seven!” i answered.\\n\\n“indeed, i should have thought a little more. just a trifle more, i\\nfancy, watson. and in practice again, i observe. you did not tell me\\nthat you intended to go into harness.”\\n\\n“then, how do you know?”\\n\\n“i see it, i deduce it. how do i know that you have been getting\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\nservant girl?”\\n\\n“my dear holmes,” said i, “this is too much. you would certainly have\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. it is true that i had a\\ncountry walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as i\\nhave changed my clothes i can’t imagine how you deduce it. as to mary\\njane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\\nagain, i fail to see how you work it out.”\\n\\nhe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\n\\n“it is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\\nscored by six almost parallel cuts. obviously they have been caused by\\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\\norder to remove crusted mud from it. hence, you see, my double\\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the london slavey. as\\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, i must be dull, indeed, if i do not\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\\n\\ni could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\nprocess of deduction. “when i hear you give your reasons,” i remarked,\\n“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\nreasoning i am baffled until you explain your process. and yet i\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.”\\n\\n“quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\ndown into an armchair. “you see, but you do not observe. the\\ndistinction is clear. for example, you have frequently seen the steps\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.”\\n\\n“frequently.”\\n\\n“how often?”\\n\\n“well, some hundreds of times.”\\n\\n“then how many are there?”\\n\\n“how many? i don’t know.”\\n\\n“quite so! you have not observed. and yet you have seen. that is just\\nmy point. now, i know that there are seventeen steps, because i have\\nboth seen and observed. by the way, since you are interested in these\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” he threw\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\\nupon the table. “it came by the last post,” said he. “read it aloud.”\\n\\nthe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\n\\n“there will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\\nsaid, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\\ndeepest moment. your recent services to one of the royal houses of\\neurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\\nthis account of you we have from all quarters received. be in your\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\nwear a mask.”\\n\\n“this is indeed a mystery,” i remarked. “what do you imagine that it\\nmeans?”\\n\\n“i have no data yet. it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\\ndata. insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\ntheories to suit facts. but the note itself. what do you deduce from\\nit?”\\n\\ni carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\nwritten.\\n\\n“the man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” i remarked,\\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “such paper could not\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. it is peculiarly strong and\\nstiff.”\\n\\n“peculiar—that is the very word,” said holmes. “it is not an english\\npaper at all. hold it up to the light.”\\n\\ni did so, and saw a large “e” with a small “g,” a “p,” and a large “g”\\nwith a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\\n\\n“what do you make of that?” asked holmes.\\n\\n“the name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\\n\\n“not at all. the ‘g’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘gesellschaft,’\\nwhich is the german for ‘company.’ it is a customary contraction like\\nour ‘co.’ ‘p,’ of course, stands for ‘papier.’ now for the ‘eg.’ let us\\nglance at our continental gazetteer.” he took down a heavy brown volume\\nfrom his shelves. “eglow, eglonitz—here we are, egria. it is in a\\ngerman-speaking country—in bohemia, not far from carlsbad. ‘remarkable\\nas being the scene of the death of wallenstein, and for its numerous\\nglass-factories and paper-mills.’ ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\\nthat?” his eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\\nfrom his cigarette.\\n\\n“the paper was made in bohemia,” i said.\\n\\n“precisely. and the man who wrote the note is a german. do you note the\\npeculiar construction of the sentence—‘this account of you we have from\\nall quarters received.’ a frenchman or russian could not have written\\nthat. it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs. it only\\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this german who\\nwrites upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\\nface. and here he comes, if i am not mistaken, to resolve all our\\ndoubts.”\\n\\nas he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating\\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. holmes\\nwhistled.\\n\\n“a pair, by the sound,” said he. “yes,” he continued, glancing out of\\nthe window. “a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. a hundred\\nand fifty guineas apiece. there’s money in this case, watson, if there\\nis nothing else.”\\n\\n“i think that i had better go, holmes.”\\n\\n“not a bit, doctor. stay where you are. i am lost without my boswell.\\nand this promises to be interesting. it would be a pity to miss it.”\\n\\n“but your client—”\\n\\n“never mind him. i may want your help, and so may he. here he comes.\\nsit down in that armchair, doctor, and give us your best attention.”\\n\\na slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. then there was a loud and\\nauthoritative tap.\\n\\n“come in!” said holmes.\\n\\na man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a hercules. his dress was rich\\nwith a richness which would, in england, be looked upon as akin to bad\\ntaste. heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\\nberyl. boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. he\\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\\nwas still raised to it as he entered. from the lower part of the face\\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\\nof obstinacy.\\n\\n“you had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\nmarked german accent. “i told you that i would call.” he looked from\\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\n\\n“pray take a seat,” said holmes. “this is my friend and colleague, dr.\\nwatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. whom\\nhave i the honour to address?”\\n\\n“you may address me as the count von kramm, a bohemian nobleman. i\\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\\ndiscretion, whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme\\nimportance. if not, i should much prefer to communicate with you\\nalone.”\\n\\ni rose to go, but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\nmy chair. “it is both, or none,” said he. “you may say before this\\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.”\\n\\nthe count shrugged his broad shoulders. “then i must begin,” said he,\\n“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. at present it is not too\\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\\neuropean history.”\\n\\n“i promise,” said holmes.\\n\\n“and i.”\\n\\n“you will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “the august\\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and i may\\nconfess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is\\nnot exactly my own.”\\n\\n“i was aware of it,” said holmes dryly.\\n\\n“the circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe. to speak\\nplainly, the matter implicates the great house of ormstein, hereditary\\nkings of bohemia.”\\n\\n“i was also aware of that,” murmured holmes, settling himself down in\\nhis armchair and closing his eyes.\\n\\nour visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe. holmes\\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\n\\n“if your majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “i\\nshould be better able to advise you.”\\n\\nthe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\nuncontrollable agitation. then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “you are right,”\\nhe cried; “i am the king. why should i attempt to conceal it?”\\n\\n“why, indeed?” murmured holmes. “your majesty had not spoken before i\\nwas aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von\\normstein, grand duke of cassel-felstein, and hereditary king of\\nbohemia.”\\n\\n“but you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once\\nmore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can\\nunderstand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\\nperson. yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to\\nan agent without putting myself in his power. i have come _incognito_\\nfrom prague for the purpose of consulting you.”\\n\\n“then, pray consult,” said holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\n\\n“the facts are briefly these: some five years ago, during a lengthy\\nvisit to warsaw, i made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\\nirene adler. the name is no doubt familiar to you.”\\n\\n“kindly look her up in my index, doctor,” murmured holmes without\\nopening his eyes. for many years he had adopted a system of docketing\\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\\nname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\\ninformation. in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between\\nthat of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\n\\n“let me see!” said holmes. “hum! born in new jersey in the year 1858.\\ncontralto—hum! la scala, hum! prima donna imperial opera of warsaw—yes!\\nretired from operatic stage—ha! living in london—quite so! your\\nmajesty, as i understand, became entangled with this young person,\\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting\\nthose letters back.”\\n\\n“precisely so. but how—”\\n\\n“was there a secret marriage?”\\n\\n“none.”\\n\\n“no legal papers or certificates?”\\n\\n“none.”\\n\\n“then i fail to follow your majesty. if this young person should\\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\nprove their authenticity?”\\n\\n“there is the writing.”\\n\\n“pooh, pooh! forgery.”\\n\\n“my private note-paper.”\\n\\n“stolen.”\\n\\n“my own seal.”\\n\\n“imitated.”\\n\\n“my photograph.”\\n\\n“bought.”\\n\\n“we were both in the photograph.”\\n\\n“oh, dear! that is very bad! your majesty has indeed committed an\\nindiscretion.”\\n\\n“i was mad—insane.”\\n\\n“you have compromised yourself seriously.”\\n\\n“i was only crown prince then. i was young. i am but thirty now.”\\n\\n“it must be recovered.”\\n\\n“we have tried and failed.”\\n\\n“your majesty must pay. it must be bought.”\\n\\n“she will not sell.”\\n\\n“stolen, then.”\\n\\n“five attempts have been made. twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\nhouse. once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. twice she has\\nbeen waylaid. there has been no result.”\\n\\n“no sign of it?”\\n\\n“absolutely none.”\\n\\nholmes laughed. “it is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.\\n\\n“but a very serious one to me,” returned the king reproachfully.\\n\\n“very, indeed. and what does she propose to do with the photograph?”\\n\\n“to ruin me.”\\n\\n“but how?”\\n\\n“i am about to be married.”\\n\\n“so i have heard.”\\n\\n“to clotilde lothman von saxe-meningen, second daughter of the king of\\nscandinavia. you may know the strict principles of her family. she is\\nherself the very soul of delicacy. a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\nwould bring the matter to an end.”\\n\\n“and irene adler?”\\n\\n“threatens to send them the photograph. and she will do it. i know that\\nshe will do it. you do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. she\\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\\nresolute of men. rather than i should marry another woman, there are no\\nlengths to which she would not go—none.”\\n\\n“you are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\n\\n“i am sure.”\\n\\n“and why?”\\n\\n“because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. that will be next monday.”\\n\\n“oh, then we have three days yet,” said holmes with a yawn. “that is\\nvery fortunate, as i have one or two matters of importance to look into\\njust at present. your majesty will, of course, stay in london for the\\npresent?”\\n\\n“certainly. you will find me at the langham under the name of the count\\nvon kramm.”\\n\\n“then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”\\n\\n“pray do so. i shall be all anxiety.”\\n\\n“then, as to money?”\\n\\n“you have _carte blanche_.”\\n\\n“absolutely?”\\n\\n“i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\\nhave that photograph.”\\n\\n“and for present expenses?”\\n\\nthe king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\\nit on the table.\\n\\n“there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he\\nsaid.\\n\\nholmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\\nto him.\\n\\n“and mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\\n\\n“is briony lodge, serpentine avenue, st. john’s wood.”\\n\\nholmes took a note of it. “one other question,” said he. “was the\\nphotograph a cabinet?”\\n\\n“it was.”\\n\\n“then, good-night, your majesty, and i trust that we shall soon have\\nsome good news for you. and good-night, watson,” he added, as the\\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “if you will be\\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock i should like\\nto chat this little matter over with you.”\\n\\n\\nii.\\n\\nat three o’clock precisely i was at baker street, but holmes had not\\nyet returned. the landlady informed me that he had left the house\\nshortly after eight o’clock in the morning. i sat down beside the fire,\\nhowever, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.\\ni was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was\\nsurrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\\nassociated with the two crimes which i have already recorded, still,\\nthe nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a\\ncharacter of its own. indeed, apart from the nature of the\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\\nmysteries. so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very\\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\\n\\nit was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. accustomed as i was to my\\nfriend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, i had to look three\\ntimes before i was certain that it was indeed he. with a nod he\\nvanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old. putting his hands into his\\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\\nheartily for some minutes.\\n\\n“well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he\\nwas obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\n\\n“what is it?”\\n\\n“it’s quite too funny. i am sure you could never guess how i employed\\nmy morning, or what i ended by doing.”\\n\\n“i can’t imagine. i suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\nperhaps the house, of miss irene adler.”\\n\\n“quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. i will tell you, however.\\ni left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the\\ncharacter of a groom out of work. there is a wonderful sympathy and\\nfreemasonry among horsey men. be one of them, and you will know all\\nthat there is to know. i soon found briony lodge. it is a _bijou_\\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\\nthe road, two stories. chubb lock to the door. large sitting-room on\\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\\nand those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could\\nopen. behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. i walked round it and\\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\nanything else of interest.\\n\\n“i then lounged down the street and found, as i expected, that there\\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. i lent\\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in\\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\\nand as much information as i could desire about miss adler, to say\\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was\\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies i was compelled to\\nlisten to.”\\n\\n“and what of irene adler?” i asked.\\n\\n“oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. she is the\\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. so say the\\nserpentine-mews, to a man. she lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. seldom\\ngoes

godfrey\\nnorton, of the inner temple. see the advantages of a cabman as a\\nconfidant. they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine-mews,\\nand knew all about him. when i had listened to all they had to tell, i\\nbegan to walk up and down near briony lodge once more, and to think\\nover my plan of campaign.\\n\\n“this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\\nhe was a lawyer. that sounded ominous. what was the relation between\\nthem, and what the object of his repeated visits? was she his client,\\nhis friend, or his mistress? if the former, she had probably\\ntransferred the photograph to his keeping. if the latter, it was less\\nlikely. on the issue of this question depended whether i should\\ncontinue my work at briony lodge, or turn my attention to the\\ngentleman’s chambers in the temple. it was a delicate point, and it\\nwidened the field of my inquiry. i fear that i bore you with these\\ndetails, but i have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\\nto understand the situation.”\\n\\n“i am following you closely,” i answered.\\n\\n“i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\\nto briony lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. he was a remarkably\\nhandsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom\\ni had heard. he appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\\nto wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\\na man who was thoroughly at home.\\n\\n“he was in the house about half an hour, and i could catch glimpses of\\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\\nexcitedly, and waving his arms. of her i could see nothing. presently\\nhe emerged, looking even more flurried than before. as he stepped up to\\nthe cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\\nearnestly, ‘drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to gross &\\nhankey’s in regent street, and then to the church of st. monica in the\\nedgeware road. half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\\n\\n“away they went, and i was just wondering whether i should not do well\\nto follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman\\nwith his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all\\nthe tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. it hadn’t\\npulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. i only\\ncaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with\\na face that a man might die for.\\n\\n“‘the church of st. monica, john,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if\\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.’\\n\\n“this was quite too good to lose, watson. i was just balancing whether\\ni should run for it, or whether i should perch behind her landau when a\\ncab came through the street. the driver looked twice at such a shabby\\nfare, but i jumped in before he could object. ‘the church of st.\\nmonica,’ said i, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\\nminutes.’ it was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\\nclear enough what was in the wind.\\n\\n“my cabby drove fast. i don’t think i ever drove faster, but the others\\nwere there before us. the cab and the landau with their steaming horses\\nwere in front of the door when i arrived. i paid the man and hurried\\ninto the church. there was not a soul there save the two whom i had\\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\\nthem. they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. i\\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\\nchurch. suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\nme, and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\\n\\n“‘thank god,’ he cried. ‘you’ll do. come! come!’\\n\\n“‘what then?’ i asked.\\n\\n“‘come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’\\n\\n“i was half-dragged up to the altar, and before i knew where i was i\\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\\nvouching for things of which i knew nothing, and generally assisting in\\nthe secure tying up of irene adler, spinster, to godfrey norton,\\nbachelor. it was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\\nclergyman beamed on me in front. it was the most preposterous position\\nin which i ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it\\nthat started me laughing just now. it seems that there had been some\\ninformality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\\nstreets in search of a best man. the bride gave me a sovereign, and i\\nmean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”\\n\\n“this is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said i; “and what then?”\\n\\n“well, i found my plans very seriously menaced. it looked as if the\\npair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\\nand energetic measures on my part. at the church door, however, they\\nseparated, he driving back to the temple, and she to her own house. ‘i\\nshall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left\\nhim. i heard no more. they drove away in different directions, and i\\nwent off to make my own arrangements.”\\n\\n“which are?”\\n\\n“some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “i\\nhave been too busy to think of food, and i am likely to be busier still\\nthis evening. by the way, doctor, i shall want your co-operation.”\\n\\n“i shall be delighted.”\\n\\n“you don’t mind breaking the law?”\\n\\n“not in the least.”\\n\\n“nor running a chance of arrest?”\\n\\n“not in a good cause.”\\n\\n“oh, the cause is excellent!”\\n\\n“then i am your man.”\\n\\n“i was sure that i might rely on you.”\\n\\n“but what is it you wish?”\\n\\n“when mrs. turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you.\\nnow,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\\nlandlady had provided, “i must discuss it while i eat, for i have not\\nmuch time. it is nearly five now. in two hours we must be on the scene\\nof action. miss irene, or madame, rather, returns from her drive at\\nseven. we must be at briony lodge to meet her.”\\n\\n“and what then?”\\n\\n“you must leave that to me. i have already arranged what is to occur.\\nthere is only one point on which i must insist. you must not interfere,\\ncome what may. you understand?”\\n\\n“i am to be neutral?”\\n\\n“to do nothing whatever. there will probably be some small\\nunpleasantness. do not join in it. it will end in my being conveyed\\ninto the house. four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\\nwill open. you are to station yourself close to that open window.”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“you are to watch me, for i will be visible to you.”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“and when i raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what i give\\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. you\\nquite follow me?”\\n\\n“entirely.”\\n\\n“it is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\\nroll from his pocket. “it is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted\\nwith a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. your task is\\nconfined to that. when you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\\nby quite a number of people. you may then walk to the end of the\\nstreet, and i will rejoin you in ten minutes. i hope that i have made\\nmyself clear?”\\n\\n“i am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at\\nthe signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\\nto wait you at the corner of the street.”\\n\\n“precisely.”\\n\\n“then you may entirely rely on me.”\\n\\n“that is excellent. i think, perhaps, it is almost time that i prepare\\nfor the new role i have to play.”\\n\\nhe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded nonconformist clergyman. his\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\\nsmile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\\nas mr. john hare alone could have equalled. it was not merely that\\nholmes changed his costume. his expression, his manner, his very soul\\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. the stage lost a\\nfine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\\nspecialist in crime.\\n\\nit was a quarter past six when we left baker street, and it still\\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine\\navenue. it was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\\nwe paced up and down in front of briony lodge, waiting for the coming\\nof its occupant. the house was just such as i had pictured it from\\nsherlock holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\\nless private than i expected. on the contrary, for a small street in a\\nquiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. there was a group of\\nshabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\\nscissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\\nnurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\\ndown with cigars in their mouths.\\n\\n“you see,” remarked holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\\nhouse, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. the photograph becomes\\na double-edged weapon now. the chances are that she would be as averse\\nto its being seen by mr. godfrey norton, as our client is to its coming\\nto the eyes of his princess. now the question is, where are we to find\\nthe photograph?”\\n\\n“where, indeed?”\\n\\n“it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. it is cabinet\\nsize. too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. she knows\\nthat the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched. two\\nattempts of the sort have already been made. we may take it, then, that\\nshe does not carry it about with her.”\\n\\n“where, then?”\\n\\n“her banker or her lawyer. there is that double possibility. but i am\\ninclined to think neither. women are naturally secretive, and they like\\nto do their own secreting. why should she hand it over to anyone else?\\nshe could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\\nindirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\\nbusiness man. besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\\na few days. it must be where she can lay her hands upon it. it must be\\nin her own house.”\\n\\n“but it has twice been burgled.”\\n\\n“pshaw! they did not know how to look.”\\n\\n“but how will you look?”\\n\\n“i will not look.”\\n\\n“what then?”\\n\\n“i will get her to show me.”\\n\\n“but she will refuse.”\\n\\n“she will not be able to. but i hear the rumble of wheels. it is her\\ncarriage. now carry out my orders to the letter.”\\n\\nas he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\\ncurve of the avenue. it was a smart little landau which rattled up to\\nthe door of briony lodge. as it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\\nthe corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\\ncopper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\\nthe same intention. a fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\\nthe two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\\nscissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. a blow was\\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\\nwas the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. holmes\\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\\nhe gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\\ndown his face. at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\\ndirection and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\\ndressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. irene\\nadler, as i will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\\nstood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\\n\\n“is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\\n\\n“he is dead,” cried several voices.\\n\\n“no, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “but he’ll be gone\\nbefore you can get him to hospital.”\\n\\n“he’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “they would have had the lady’s\\npurse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. they were a gang, and a\\nrough one, too. ah, he’s breathing now.”\\n\\n“he can’t lie in the street. may we bring him in, marm?”\\n\\n“surely. bring him into the sitting-room. there is a comfortable sofa.\\nthis way, please!”\\n\\nslowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the\\nprincipal room, while i still observed the proceedings from my post by\\nthe window. the lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\\nso that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch. i do not know\\nwhether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\\nwas playing, but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of\\nmyself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i\\nwas conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\\nthe injured man. and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes\\nto draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. i hardened\\nmy heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. after all, i\\nthought, we are not injuring her. we are but preventing her from\\ninjuring another.\\n\\nholmes had sat up upon the couch, and i saw him motion like a man who\\nis in need of air. a maid rushed across and threw open the window. at\\nthe same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my\\nrocket into the room with a cry of “fire!” the word was no sooner out\\nof my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\\nill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of\\n“fire!” thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\\nopen window. i caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\\nthe voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\\nalarm. slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner\\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm\\nin mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. he walked swiftly\\nand in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\\nquiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road.\\n\\n“you did it very nicely, doctor,” he remarked. “nothing could have been\\nbetter. it is all right.”\\n\\n“you have the photograph?”\\n\\n“i know where it is.”\\n\\n“and how did you find out?”\\n\\n“she showed me, as i told you she would.”\\n\\n“i am still in the dark.”\\n\\n“i do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “the matter was\\nperfectly simple. you, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\\nan accomplice. they were all engaged for the evening.”\\n\\n“i guessed as much.”\\n\\n“then, when the row broke out, i had a little moist red paint in the\\npalm of my hand. i rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\\nface, and became a piteous spectacle. it is an old trick.”\\n\\n“that also i could fathom.”\\n\\n“then they carried me in. she was bound to have me in. what else could\\nshe do? and into her sitting-room, which was the very room which i\\nsuspected. it lay between that and her bedroom, and i was determined to\\nsee which. they laid me on a couch, i motioned for air, they were\\ncompelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\\n\\n“how did that help you?”\\n\\n“it was all-important. when a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. it\\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and i have more than once taken\\nadvantage of it. in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it\\nwas of use to me, and also in the arnsworth castle business. a married\\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\\nnow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. she would rush to\\nsecure it. the alarm of fire was admirably done. the smoke and shouting\\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel. she responded beautifully. the\\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\\nbell-pull. she was there in an instant, and i caught a glimpse of it as\\nshe half drew it out. when i cried out that it was a false alarm, she\\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and i have\\nnot seen her since. i rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\\nhouse. i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\\nseemed safer to wait. a little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\\n\\n“and now?” i asked.\\n\\n“our quest is practically finished. i shall call with the king\\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. we will be shown\\ninto the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\\nwhen she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. it might be\\na satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\\n\\n“and when will you call?”\\n\\n“at eight in the morning. she will not be up, so that we shall have a\\nclear field. besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\\ncomplete change in her life and habits. i must wire to the king without\\ndelay.”\\n\\nwe had reached baker street and had stopped at the door. he was\\nsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\\n\\n“good-night, mister sherlock holmes.”\\n\\nthere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\n\\n“i’ve heard that voice before,” said holmes, staring down the dimly lit\\nstreet. “now, i wonder who the deuce that could have been.”\\n\\n\\niii.\\n\\ni slept at baker street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\\nand coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the\\nroom.\\n\\n“you have really got it!” he cried, grasping sherlock holmes by either\\nshoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\\n\\n“not yet.”\\n\\n“but you have hopes?”\\n\\n“i have hopes.”\\n\\n“then, come. i am all impatience to be gone.”\\n\\n“we must have a cab.”\\n\\n“no, my brougham is waiting.”\\n\\n“then that will simplify matters.” we descended and started off once\\nmore for briony lodge.\\n\\n“irene adler is married,” remarked holmes.\\n\\n“married! when?”\\n\\n“yesterday.”\\n\\n“but to whom?”\\n\\n“to an english lawyer named norton.”\\n\\n“but she could not love him.”\\n\\n“i am in hopes that she does.”\\n\\n“and why in hopes?”\\n\\n“because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance. if\\nthe lady loves her husband, she does not love your majesty. if she does\\nnot love your majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\\nyour majesty’s plan.”\\n\\n“it is true. and yet—! well! i wish she had been of my own station!\\nwhat a queen she would have made!” he relapsed into a moody silence,\\nwhich was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue.\\n\\nthe door of briony lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\\nsteps. she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\nbrougham.\\n\\n“mr. sherlock holmes, i believe?” said she.\\n\\n“i am mr. holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\n\\n“indeed! my mistress told me that you were likely to call. she left\\nthis morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from charing cross for\\nthe continent.”\\n\\n“what!” sherlock holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\nsurprise. “do you mean that she has left england?”\\n\\n“never to return.”\\n\\n“and the papers?” asked the king hoarsely. “all is lost.”\\n\\n“we shall see.” he pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\ndrawing-room, followed by the king and myself. the furniture was\\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\\nholmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\\nplunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. the\\nphotograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\\nsuperscribed to “sherlock holmes, esq. to be left till called for.” my\\nfriend tore it open, and we all three read it together. it was dated at\\nmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\\n\\n    “my dear mr. sherlock holmes,—you really did it very well. you took\\n    me in completely. until after the alarm of fire, i had not a\\n    suspicion. but then, when i found how i had betrayed myself, i\\n    began to think. i had been warned against you months ago. i had\\n    been told that, if the king employed an agent, it would certainly\\n    be you. and your address had been given me. yet, with all this, you\\n    made me reveal what you wanted to know. even after i became\\n    suspicious, i found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\\n    clergyman. but, you know, i have been trained as an actress myself.\\n    male costume is nothing new to me. i often take advantage of the\\n    freedom which it gives. i sent john, the coachman, to watch you,\\n    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as i call them, and came\\n    down just as you departed.\\n\\n    “well, i followed you to your door, and so made sure that i was\\n    really an object of interest to the celebrated mr. sherlock holmes.\\n    then i, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\\n    the temple to see my husband.\\n\\n    “we both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\\n    formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you\\n    call to-morrow. as to the photograph, your client may rest in\\n    peace. i love and am loved by a better man than he. the king may do\\n    what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\\n    wronged. i keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\\n    weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\\n    take in the future. i leave a photograph which he might care to\\n    possess; and i remain, dear mr. sherlock holmes,\\n\\n\\n    “very truly yours,\\n\\n    “irene norton, _née_ adler.”\\n\\n\\n“what a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the king of bohemia, when we had\\nall three read this epistle. “did i not tell you how quick and resolute\\nshe was? would she not have made an admirable queen? is it not a pity\\nthat she was not on my level?”\\n\\n“from what i have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\\ndifferent level to your majesty,” said holmes coldly. “i am sorry that\\ni have not been able to bring your majesty’s business to a more\\nsuccessful conclusion.”\\n\\n“on the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the king; “nothing could be more\\nsuccessful. i know that her word is inviolate. the photograph is now as\\nsafe as if it were in the fire.”\\n\\n“i am glad to hear your majesty say so.”\\n\\n“i am immensely indebted to you. pray tell me in what way i can reward\\nyou. this ring—” he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\n\\n“your majesty has something which i should value even more highly,”\\nsaid holmes.\\n\\n“you have but to name it.”\\n\\n“this photograph!”\\n\\nthe king stared at him in amazement.\\n\\n“irene’s photograph!” he cried. “certainly, if you wish it.”\\n\\n“i thank your majesty. then there is no more to be done in the matter.\\ni have the honour to wish you a very good morning.” he bowed, and,\\nturning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched\\nout to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\\n\\nand that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\nbohemia, and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a\\nwoman’s wit. he used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but i\\nhave not heard him do it of late. and when he speaks of irene adler, or\\nwhen he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable\\ntitle of _the_ woman.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nii. the red-headed league\\n\\n\\n i had called upon my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, one day in the\\n autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very\\n stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. with an\\n apology for my intrusion, i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled\\n me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\\n\\n“you could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear watson,” he\\nsaid cordially.\\n\\n“i was afraid that you were engaged.”\\n\\n“so i am. very much so.”\\n\\n“then i can wait in the next room.”\\n\\n“not at all. this gentleman, mr. wilson, has been my partner and helper\\nin many of my most successful cases, and i have no doubt that he will\\nbe of the utmost use to me in yours also.”\\n\\nthe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of\\ngreeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small\\nfat-encircled eyes.\\n\\n“try the settee,” said holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting\\nhis fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “i\\nknow, my dear watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and\\noutside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. you have\\nshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to\\nchronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish\\nso many of my own little adventures.”\\n\\n“your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” i\\nobserved.\\n\\n“you will remember that i remarked the other day, just before we went\\ninto the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland, that\\nfor strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life\\nitself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\\nimagination.”\\n\\n“a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting.”\\n\\n“you did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for\\notherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your\\nreason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. now, mr.\\njabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,\\nand to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular\\nwhich i have listened to for some time. you have heard me remark that\\nthe strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with\\nthe larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where\\nthere is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.\\nas far as i have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the\\npresent case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events\\nis certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to.\\nperhaps, mr. wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence\\nyour narrative. i ask you not merely because my friend dr. watson has\\nnot heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the\\nstory makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. as\\na rule, when i have heard some slight indication of the course of\\nevents, i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar\\ncases which occur to my memory. in the present instance i am forced to\\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”\\n\\nthe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\\nlittle pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside\\npocket of his greatcoat. as he glanced down the advertisement column,\\nwith his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee,\\ni took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my\\ncompanion, to read the indications which might be presented by his\\ndress or appearance.\\n\\ni did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. our visitor bore\\nevery mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman, obese,\\npompous, and slow. he wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers,\\na not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab\\nwaistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain, and a square pierced bit of\\nmetal dangling down as an ornament. a frayed top-hat and a faded brown\\novercoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.\\naltogether, look as i would, there was nothing remarkable about the man\\nsave his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and\\ndiscontent upon his features.\\n\\nsherlock holmes’ quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head\\nwith a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “beyond the obvious\\nfacts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff,\\nthat he is a freemason, that he has been in china, and that he has done\\na considerable amount of writing lately, i can deduce nothing else.”\\n\\nmr. jabez wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the\\npaper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\n\\n“how, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, mr. holmes?”\\nhe asked. “how did you know, for example, that i did manual labour.\\nit’s as true as gospel, for i began as a ship’s carpenter.”\\n\\n“your hands, my dear sir. your right hand is quite a size larger than\\nyour left. you have worked with it, and the muscles are more\\ndeveloped.”\\n\\n“well, the snuff, then, and the freemasonry?”\\n\\n“i won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that,\\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use\\nan arc-and-compass breastpin.”\\n\\n“ah, of course, i forgot that. but the writing?”\\n\\n“what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\\ninches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you\\nrest it upon the desk?”\\n\\n“well, but china?”\\n\\n“the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\\ncould only have been done in china. i have made a small study of tattoo\\nmarks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. that\\ntrick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite\\npeculiar to china. when, in addition, i see a chinese coin hanging from\\nyour watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”\\n\\nmr. jabez wilson laughed heavily. “well, i never!” said he. “i thought\\nat first that you had done something clever, but i see that there was\\nnothing in it after all.”\\n\\n“i begin to think, watson,” said holmes, “that i make a mistake in\\nexplaining. ‘_omne ignotum pro magnifico_,’ you know, and my poor\\nlittle reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if i am so\\ncandid. can you not find the advertisement, mr. wilson?”\\n\\n“yes, i have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger planted\\nhalfway down the column. “here it is. this is what began it all. you\\njust read it for yourself, sir.”\\n\\ni took the paper from him and read as follows:\\n\\n“to the red-headed league: on account of the bequest of the late\\nezekiah hopkins, of lebanon, pennsylvania, u.s.a., there is now another\\nvacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of £ 4 a\\nweek for purely nominal services. all red-headed men who are sound in\\nbody and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.\\napply in person on monday, at eleven o’clock, to duncan ross, at the\\noffices of the league, 7 pope’s court, fleet street.”\\n\\n\\n“what on earth does this mean?” i ejaculated after i had twice read\\nover the extraordinary announcement.\\n\\nholmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in\\nhigh spirits. “it is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said he.\\n“and now, mr. wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about\\nyourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\\nupon your fortunes. you will first make a note, doctor, of the paper\\nand the date.”\\n\\n“it is _the morning chronicle_ of april 27, 1890. just two months ago.”\\n\\n“very good. now, mr. wilson?”\\n\\n“well, it is just as i have been telling you, mr. sherlock holmes,”\\nsaid jabez wilson, mopping his forehead; “i have a small pawnbroker’s\\nbusiness at coburg square, near the city. it’s not a very large affair,\\nand of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. i\\nused to be able to keep two assistants, but now i only keep one; and i\\nwould have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half\\nwages so as to learn the business.”\\n\\n“what is the name of this obliging youth?” asked sherlock holmes.\\n\\n“his name is vincent spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. it’s\\nhard to say his age. i should not wish a smarter assistant, mr. holmes;\\nand i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i\\nam able to give him. but, after all, if he is satisfied, why should i\\nput ideas in his head?”\\n\\n“why, indeed? you seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who comes\\nunder the full market price. it is not a common experience among\\nemployers in this age. i don’t know that your assistant is not as\\nremarkable as your advertisement.”\\n\\n“oh, he has his faults, too,” said mr. wilson. “never was such a fellow\\nfor photography. snapping away with a camera when he ought to be\\nimproving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit\\ninto its hole to develop his pictures. that is his main fault, but on\\nthe whole he’s a good worker. there’s no vice in him.”\\n\\n“he is still with you, i presume?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. he and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking\\nand keeps the place clean—that’s all i have in the house, for i am a\\nwidower and never had any family. we live very quietly, sir, the three\\nof us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do\\nnothing more.\\n\\n“the first thing that put us out was that advertisement. spaulding, he\\ncame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very\\npaper in his hand, and he says:\\n\\n“‘i wish to the lord, mr. wilson, that i was a red-headed man.’\\n\\n“‘why that?’ i asks.\\n\\n“‘why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the league of the\\nred-headed men. it’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets\\nit, and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,\\nso that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.\\nif my hair would only change colour, here’s a nice little crib all\\nready for me to step into.’\\n\\n“‘why, what is it, then?’ i asked. you see, mr. holmes, i am a very\\nstay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to\\ngo to it, i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the\\ndoor-mat. in that way i didn’t know much of what was going on outside,\\nand i was always glad of a bit of news.\\n\\n“‘have you never heard of the league of the red-headed men?’ he asked\\nwith his eyes open.\\n\\n“‘never.’\\n\\n“‘why, i wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\nvacancies.’\\n\\n“‘and what are they worth?’ i asked.\\n\\n“‘oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it\\nneed not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’\\n\\n“well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\nbusiness has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of\\nhundred would have been very handy.\\n\\n“‘tell me all about it,’ said i.\\n\\n“‘well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for\\nyourself that the league has a vacancy, and there is the address where\\nyou should apply for particulars. as far as i can make out, the league\\nwas founded by an american millionaire, ezekiah hopkins, who was very\\npeculiar in his ways. he was himself red-headed, and he had a great\\nsympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he\\nhad left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\\ninstructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to\\nmen whose hair is of that colour. from all i hear it is splendid pay\\nand very little to do.’\\n\\n“‘but,’ said i, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\napply.’\\n\\n“‘not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘you see it is really\\nconfined to londoners, and to grown men. this american had started from\\nlondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\\nthen, again, i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is\\nlight red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery\\nred. now, if you cared to apply, mr. wilson, you would just walk in;\\nbut perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of\\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’\\n\\n“now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\\nhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if\\nthere was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance\\nas any man that i had ever met. vincent spaulding seemed to know so\\nmuch about it that i thought he might prove useful, so i just ordered\\nhim to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.\\nhe was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and\\nstarted off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\\n\\n“i never hope to see such a sight as that again, mr. holmes. from\\nnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his\\nhair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. fleet\\nstreet was choked with red-headed folk, and pope’s court looked like a\\ncoster’s orange barrow. i should not have thought there were so many in\\nthe whole country as were brought together by that single\\nadvertisement. every shade of colour they were—straw, lemon, orange,\\nbrick, irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as spaulding said, there were\\nnot many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. when i saw how\\nmany were waiting, i would have given it up in despair; but spaulding\\nwould not hear of it. how he did it i could not imagine, but he pushed\\nand pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up\\nto the steps which led to the office. there was a double stream upon\\nthe stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we\\nwedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.”\\n\\n“your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked holmes as\\nhis client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\\n“pray continue your very interesting statement.”\\n\\n“there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\\ndeal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even\\nredder than mine. he said a few words to each candidate as he came up,\\nand then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\\ndisqualify them. getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy\\nmatter, after all. however, when our turn came the little man was much\\nmore favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\\nas we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\\n\\n“‘this is mr. jabez wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to\\nfill a vacancy in the league.’\\n\\n“‘and he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘he has every\\nrequirement. i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine.’ he\\ntook a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair\\nuntil i felt quite bashful. then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my\\nhand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\n\\n“‘it would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘you will, however, i am\\nsure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ with that he seized\\nmy hair in both his hands, and tugged until i yelled with the pain.\\n‘there is water in your eyes,’ said he as he released me. ‘i perceive\\nthat all is as it should be. but we have to be careful, for we have\\ntwice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. i could tell you tales\\nof cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ he stepped\\nover to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that\\nthe vacancy was filled. a groan of disappointment came up from below,\\nand the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was\\nnot a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\n\\n“‘my name,’ said he, ‘is mr. duncan ross, and i am myself one of the\\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. are you a\\nmarried man, mr. wilson? have you a family?’\\n\\n“i answered that i had not.\\n\\n“his face fell immediately.\\n\\n“‘dear me!’ he said gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! i am sorry\\nto hear you say that. the fund was, of course, for the propagation and\\nspread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. it is\\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\\n\\n“my face lengthened at this, mr. holmes, for i thought that i was not\\nto have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few\\nminutes he said that it would be all right.\\n\\n“‘in the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but\\nwe must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as\\nyours. when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\\n\\n“‘well, it is a little awkward, for i have a business already,’ said i.\\n\\n“‘oh, never mind about that, mr. wilson!’ said vincent spaulding. ‘i\\nshould be able to look after that for you.’\\n\\n“‘what would be the hours?’ i asked.\\n\\n“‘ten to two.’\\n\\n“now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, mr. holmes,\\nespecially thursday and friday evening, which is just before pay-day;\\nso it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.\\nbesides, i knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see\\nto anything that turned up.\\n\\n“‘that would suit me very well,’ said i. ‘and the pay?’\\n\\n“‘is £ 4 a week.’\\n\\n“‘and the work?’\\n\\n“‘is purely nominal.’\\n\\n“‘what do you call purely nominal?’\\n\\n“‘well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the\\nwhole time. if you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. the\\nwill is very clear upon that point. you don’t comply with the\\nconditions if you budge from the office during that time.’\\n\\n“‘it’s only four hours a day, and i should not think of leaving,’ said\\ni.\\n\\n“‘no excuse will avail,’ said mr. duncan ross; ‘neither sickness nor\\nbusiness nor anything else. there you must stay, or you lose your\\nbillet.’\\n\\n“‘and the work?’\\n\\n“‘is to copy out the _encyclopædia britannica_. there is the first\\nvolume of it in that press. you must find your own ink, pens, and\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. will you be ready\\nto-morrow?’\\n\\n“‘certainly,’ i answered.\\n\\n“‘then, good-bye, mr. jabez wilson, and let me congratulate you once\\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\ngain.’ he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant,\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, i was so pleased at my own good\\nfortune.\\n\\n“well, i thought over the matter all day, and by evening i was in low\\nspirits again; for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair\\nmust be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be i\\ncould not imagine. it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could\\nmake such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything\\nso simple as copying out the _encyclopædia britannica_. vincent\\nspaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime i had\\nreasoned myself out of the whole thing. however, in the morning i\\ndetermined to have a look at it anyhow, so i bought a penny bottle of\\nink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, i\\nstarted off for pope’s court.\\n\\n“well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.\\nthe table was set out ready for me, and mr. duncan ross was there to\\nsee that i got fairly to work. he started me off upon the letter a, and\\nthen he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all\\nwas right with me. at two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me\\nupon the amount that i had written, and locked the door of the office\\nafter me.\\n\\n“this went on day after day, mr. holmes, and on saturday the manager\\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work. it\\nwas the same next week, and the same the week after. every morning i\\nwas there at ten, and every afternoon i left at two. by degrees mr.\\nduncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a\\ntime, he did not come in at all. still, of course, i never dared to\\nleave the room for an instant, for i was not sure when he might come,\\nand the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that i would\\nnot risk the loss of it.\\n\\n“eight weeks passed away like this, and i had written about abbots and\\narchery and armour and architecture and attica, and hoped with\\ndiligence that i might get on to the b’s before very long. it cost me\\nsomething in foolscap, and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my\\nwritings. and then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”\\n\\n“to an end?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. and no later than this morning. i went to my work as usual\\nat ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square\\nof cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. here\\nit is, and you can read for yourself.”\\n\\nhe held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of\\nnote-paper. it read in this fashion:\\n\\n“the red-headed league is dissolved. october 9, 1890.”\\n\\n\\nsherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful\\nface behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely\\novertopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar\\nof laughter.\\n\\n“i cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,\\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “if you can do nothing\\nbetter than laugh at me, i can go elsewhere.”\\n\\n“no, no,” cried holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he\\nhad half risen. “i really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. it is\\nmost refreshingly unusual. but there is, if you will excuse my saying\\nso, something just a little funny about it. pray what steps did you\\ntake when you found the card upon the door?”\\n\\n“i was staggered, sir. i did not know what to do. then i called at the\\noffices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.\\nfinally, i went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\\nground floor, and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of\\nthe red-headed league. he said that he had never heard of any such\\nbody. then i asked him who mr. duncan ross was. he answered that the\\nname was new to him.\\n\\n“‘well,’ said i, ‘the gentleman at no. 4.’\\n\\n“‘what, the red-headed man?’\\n\\n“‘yes.’\\n\\n“‘oh,’ said he, ‘his name was william morris. he was a solicitor and\\nwas using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises\\nwere ready. he moved out yesterday.’\\n\\n“‘where could i find him?’\\n\\n“‘oh, at his new offices. he did tell me the address. yes, 17 king\\nedward street, near st. paul’s.’\\n\\n“i started off, mr. holmes, but when i got to that address it was a\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of\\neither mr. william morris or mr. duncan ross.”\\n\\n“and what did you do then?” asked holmes.\\n\\n“i went home to saxe-coburg square, and i took the advice of my\\nassistant. but he could not help me in any way. he could only say that\\nif i waited i should hear by post. but that was not quite good enough,\\nmr. holmes. i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,\\nas i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk\\nwho were in need of it, i came right away to you.”\\n\\n“and you did very wisely,” said holmes. “your case is an exceedingly\\nremarkable one, and i shall be happy to look into it. from what you\\nhave told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from\\nit than might at first sight appear.”\\n\\n“grave enough!” said mr. jabez wilson. “why, i have lost four pound a\\nweek.”\\n\\n“as far as you are personally concerned,” remarked holmes, “i do not\\nsee that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. on\\nthe contrary, you are, as i understand, richer by some £ 30, to say\\nnothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject\\nwhich comes under the letter a. you have lost nothing by them.”\\n\\n“no, sir. but i want to find out about them, and who they are, and what\\ntheir object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. it\\nwas a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty\\npounds.”\\n\\n“we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. and, first, one\\nor two questions, mr. wilson. this assistant of yours who first called\\nyour attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”\\n\\n“about a month then.”\\n\\n“how did he come?”\\n\\n“in answer to an advertisement.”\\n\\n“was he the only applicant?”\\n\\n“no, i had a dozen.”\\n\\n“why did you pick him?”\\n\\n“because he was handy and would come cheap.”\\n\\n“at half wages, in fact.”\\n\\n“yes.”\\n\\n“what is he like, this vincent spaulding?”\\n\\n“small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\\nthough he’s not short of thirty. has a white splash of acid upon his\\nforehead.”\\n\\nholmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “i thought as\\nmuch,” said he. “have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for\\nearrings?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a\\nlad.”\\n\\n“hum!” said holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “he is still with\\nyou?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, sir; i have only just left him.”\\n\\n“and has your business been attended to in your absence?”\\n\\n“nothing to complain of, sir. there’s never very much to do of a\\nmorning.”\\n\\n“that will do, mr. wilson. i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon\\nthe subject in the course of a day or two. to-day is saturday, and i\\nhope that by monday we may come to a conclusion.”\\n\\n“well, watson,” said holmes when our visitor had left us, “what do you\\nmake of it all?”\\n\\n“i make nothing of it,” i answered frankly. “it is a most mysterious\\nbusiness.”\\n\\n“as a rule,” said holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less\\nmysterious it proves to be. it is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most\\ndifficult to identify. but i must be prompt over this matter.”\\n\\n“what are you going to do, then?” i asked.\\n\\n“to smoke,” he answered. “it is quite a three pipe problem, and i beg\\nthat you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” he curled himself up in\\nhis chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\\nthere he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\\nlike the bill of some strange bird. i had come to the conclusion that\\nhe had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly\\nsprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his\\nmind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\\n\\n“sarasate plays at the st. james’s hall this afternoon,” he remarked.\\n“what do you think, watson? could your patients spare you for a few\\nhours?”\\n\\n“i have nothing to do to-day. my practice is never very absorbing.”\\n\\n“then put on your hat and come. i am going through the city first, and\\nwe can have some lunch on the way. i observe that there is a good deal\\nof german music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\\nitalian or french. it is introspective, and i want to introspect. come\\nalong!”\\n\\nwe travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate; and a short walk\\ntook us to saxe-coburg square, the scene of the singular story which we\\nhad listened to in the morning. it was a poky, little, shabby-genteel\\nplace, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\\ninto a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few\\nclumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden\\nand uncongenial atmosphere. three gilt balls and a brown board with\\n“jabez wilson” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the\\nplace where our red-headed client carried on his business. sherlock\\nholmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it\\nall over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. then he\\nwalked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still\\nlooking keenly at the houses. finally he returned to the pawnbroker’s,\\nand, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or\\nthree times, he went up to the door and knocked. it was instantly\\nopened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to\\nstep in.\\n\\n“thank you,” said holmes, “i only wished to ask you how you would go\\nfrom here to the strand.”\\n\\n“third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant promptly, closing\\nthe door.\\n\\n“smart fellow, that,” observed holmes as we walked away. “he is, in my\\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in london, and for daring i am not\\nsure that he has not a claim to be third. i have known something of him\\nbefore.”\\n\\n“evidently,” said i, “mr. wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in\\nthis mystery of the red-headed league. i am sure that you inquired your\\nway merely in order that you might see him.”\\n\\n“not him.”\\n\\n“what then?”\\n\\n“the knees of his trousers.”\\n\\n“and what did you see?”\\n\\n“what i expected to see.”\\n\\n“why did you beat the pavement?”\\n\\n“my dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. we are\\nspies in an enemy’s country. we know something of saxe-coburg square.\\nlet us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\\n\\nthe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from\\nthe retired saxe-coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as\\nthe front of a picture does to the back. it was one of the main\\narteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west.\\nthe roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in\\na double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with\\nthe hurrying swarm of pedestrians. it was difficult to realise as we\\nlooked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that\\nthey really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\\nsquare which we had just quitted.\\n\\n“let me see,” said holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along\\nthe line, “i should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\\nit is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london. there is\\nmortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the coburg\\nbranch of the city and suburban bank, the vegetarian restaurant, and\\nmcfarlane’s carriage-building depot. that carries us right on to the\\nother block. and now, doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had\\nsome play. a sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\\nwhere all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”\\n\\nmy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very\\ncapable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. all the\\nafternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\\ngently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\\ngently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\\nof holmes the sleuth-hound, holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. in his\\nsingular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his\\nextreme exactness and astuteness represented, as i have often thought,\\nthe reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\noccasionally predominated in him. the swing of his nature took him from\\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as i knew well, he was never\\nso truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\\nhis armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\\nthen it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\\nand that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\\nintuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\\nlook askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\\nmortals. when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st.\\njames’s hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\\nhe had set himself to hunt down.\\n\\n“you want to go home, no doubt, doctor,” he remarked as we emerged.\\n\\n“yes, it would be as well.”\\n\\n“and i have some business to do which will take some hours. this\\nbusiness at coburg square is serious.”\\n\\n“why serious?”\\n\\n“a considerable crime is in contemplation. i have every reason to\\nbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it. but to-day being saturday\\nrather complicates matters. i shall want your help to-night.”\\n\\n“at what time?”\\n\\n“ten will be early enough.”\\n\\n“i shall be at baker street at ten.”\\n\\n“very well. and, i say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so\\nkindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” he waved his hand,\\nturned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\n\\ni trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours, but i was always\\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock\\nholmes. here i had heard what he had heard, i had seen what he had\\nseen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\\nonly what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the\\nwhole business was still confused and grotesque. as i drove home to my\\nhouse in kensington i thought over it all, from the extraordinary story\\nof the red-headed copier of the _encyclopædia_ down to the visit to\\nsaxe-coburg square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from\\nme. what was this nocturnal expedition, and why should i go armed?\\nwhere were we going, and what were we to do? i had the hint from holmes\\nthat this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a\\nman who might play a deep game. i tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\\nup in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an\\nexplanation.\\n\\nit was a quarter-past nine when i started from home and made my way\\nacross the park, and so through oxford street to baker street. two\\nhansoms were standing at the door, and as i entered the passage i heard\\nthe sound of voices from above. on entering his room, i found holmes in\\nanimated conversation with two men, one of whom i recognised as peter\\njones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,\\nsad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\\nfrock-coat.\\n\\n“ha! our party is complete,” said holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket\\nand taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “watson, i think you\\nknow mr. jones, of scotland yard? let me introduce you to mr.\\nmerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”\\n\\n“we’re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see,” said jones in his\\nconsequential way. “our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\\nchase. all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”\\n\\n“i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”\\nobserved mr. merryweather gloomily.\\n\\n“you may place considerable confidence in mr. holmes, sir,” said the\\npolice agent loftily. “he has his own little methods, which are, if he\\nwon’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\\nbut he has the makings of a detective in him. it is not too much to say\\nthat once or twice, as in that business of the sholto murder and the\\nagra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official\\nforce.”\\n\\n“oh, if you say so, mr. jones, it is all right,” said the stranger with\\ndeference. “still, i confess that i miss my rubber. it is the first\\nsaturday night for seven-and-twenty years that i have not had my\\nrubber.”\\n\\n“i think you will find,” said sherlock holmes, “that you will play for\\na higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\\nwill be more exciting. for you, mr. merryweather, the stake will be\\nsome £ 30,000; and for you, jones, it will be the man upon whom you\\nwish to lay your hands.”\\n\\n“john clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. he’s a young man,\\nmr. merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and i would\\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london. he’s a\\nremarkable man, is young john clay. his grandfather was a royal duke,\\nand he himself has been to eton and oxford. his brain is as cunning as\\nhis fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\\nknow where to find the man himself. he’ll crack a crib in scotland one\\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next.\\ni’ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.”\\n\\n“i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. i’ve\\nhad one or two little turns also with mr. john clay, and i agree with\\nyou that he is at the head of his profession. it is past ten, however,\\nand quite time that we started. if you two will take the first hansom,\\nwatson and i will follow in the second.”\\n\\nsherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and\\nlay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\\nafternoon. we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\\nuntil we emerged into farrington street.\\n\\n“we are close there now,” my friend remarked. “this fellow merryweather\\nis a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. i thought\\nit as well to have jones with us also. he is not a bad fellow, though\\nan absolute imbecile in his profession. he has one positive virtue. he\\nis as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\\nclaws upon anyone. here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\\n\\nwe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\nourselves in the morning. our cabs were dismissed, and, following the\\nguidance of mr. merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and\\nthrough a side door, which he opened for us. within there was a small\\ncorridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. this also was\\nopened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\\nat another formidable gate. mr. merryweather stopped to light a\\nlantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\\nso, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\\npiled all round with crates and massive boxes.\\n\\n“you are not very vulnerable from above,” holmes remarked as he held up\\nthe lantern and gazed about him.\\n\\n“nor from below,” said mr. merryweather, striking his stick upon the\\nflags which lined the floor. “why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he\\nremarked, looking up in surprise.\\n\\n“i must really ask you to be a little more quiet!” said holmes\\nseverely. “you have already imperilled the whole success of our\\nexpedition. might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\\nupon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\\n\\nthe solemn mr. merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\ninjured expression upon his face, while holmes fell upon his knees upon\\nthe floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine\\nminutely the cracks between the stones. a few seconds sufficed to\\nsatisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his\\npocket.\\n\\n“we have at least an hour before us,” he remarked, “for they can hardly\\ntake any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. then they\\nwill not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer\\ntime they will have for their escape. we are at present, doctor—as no\\ndoubt you have divined—in the cellar of the city branch of one of the\\nprincipal london banks. mr. merryweather is the chairman of directors,\\nand he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring\\ncriminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar\\nat present.”\\n\\n“it is our french gold,” whispered the director. “we have had several\\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\\n\\n“your french gold?”\\n\\n“yes. we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and\\nborrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the bank of france. it\\nhas become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,\\nand that it is still lying in our cellar. the crate upon which i sit\\ncontains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. our\\nreserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\\nsingle branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\\nsubject.”\\n\\n“which were very well justified,” observed holmes. “and now it is time\\nthat we arranged our little plans. i expect that within an hour matters\\nwill come to a head. in the meantime mr. merryweather, we must put the\\nscreen over that dark lantern.”\\n\\n“and sit in the dark?”\\n\\n“i am afraid so. i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and i\\nthought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber\\nafter all. but i see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far\\nthat we cannot risk the presence of a light. and, first of all, we must\\nchoose our positions. these are daring men, and though we shall take\\nthem at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\\ni shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\\nthose. then, when i flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. if they\\nfire, watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\\n\\ni placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\nwhich i crouched. holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern\\nand left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness as i have never\\nbefore experienced. the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that\\nthe light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment’s notice. to\\nme, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was\\nsomething depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold\\ndank air of the vault.\\n\\n“they have but one retreat,” whispered holmes. “that is back through\\nthe house into saxe-coburg square. i hope that you have done what i\\nasked you, jones?”\\n\\n“i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\\n\\n“then we have stopped all the holes. and now we must be silent and\\nwait.”\\n\\nwhat a time it seemed! from comparing notes afterwards it was but an\\nhour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\\nalmost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. my limbs were weary and\\nstiff, for i feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up\\nto the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that i\\ncould not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but i could\\ndistinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky jones from the\\nthin, sighing note of the bank director. from my position i could look\\nover the case in the direction of the floor. suddenly my eyes caught\\nthe glint of a light.\\n\\nat first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. then it\\nlengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\\nwarning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,\\nalmost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\\nof light. for a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\\nprotruded out of the floor. then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\\nappeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\\nmarked a chink between the stones.\\n\\nits disappearance, however, was but momentary. with a rending, tearing\\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and\\nleft a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\\nlantern. over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\\nlooked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\\naperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\\nrested upon the edge. in another instant he stood at the side of the\\nhole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\\nhimself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\n\\n“it’s all clear,” he whispered. “have you the chisel and the bags?\\ngreat scott! jump, archie, jump, and i’ll swing for it!”\\n\\nsherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\\nthe other dived down the hole, and i heard the sound of rending cloth\\nas jones clutched at his skirts. the light flashed upon the barrel of a\\nrevolver, but holmes’ hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and\\nthe pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\\n\\n“it’s no use, john clay,” said holmes blandly. “you have no chance at\\nall.”\\n\\n“so i see,” the other answered with the utmost coolness. “i fancy that\\nmy pal is all right, though i see you have got his coat-tails.”\\n\\n“there are three men waiting for him at the door,” said holmes.\\n\\n“oh, indeed! you seem to have done the thing very completely. i must\\ncompliment you.”\\n\\n“and i you,” holmes answered. “your red-headed idea was very new and\\neffective.”\\n\\n“you’ll see your pal again presently,” said jones. “he’s quicker at\\nclimbing down holes than i am. just hold out while i fix the derbies.”\\n\\n“i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked our\\nprisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “you may not be\\naware that i have royal blood in my veins. have the goodness, also,\\nwhen you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\\n\\n“all right,” said jones with a stare and a snigger. “well, would you\\nplease, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\\nhighness to the police-station?”\\n\\n“that is better,” said john clay serenely. he made a sweeping bow to\\nthe three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\n\\n“really, mr. holmes,” said mr. merryweather as we followed them from\\nthe cellar, “i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\nthere is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\\ncomplete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\\nthat have ever come within my experience.”\\n\\n“i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr. john\\nclay,” said holmes. “i have been at some small expense over this\\nmatter, which i shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that i am\\namply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\\nand by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red-headed league.”\\n\\n“you see, watson,” he explained in the early hours of the morning as we\\nsat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street, “it was perfectly\\nobvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather\\nfantastic business of the advertisement of the league, and the copying\\nof the _encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker\\nout of the way for a number of hours every day. it was a curious way of\\nmanaging it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.\\nthe method was no doubt suggested to clay’s ingenious mind by the\\ncolour of his accomplice’s hair. the £ 4 a week was a lure which must\\ndraw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? they\\nput in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other\\nrogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to\\nsecure his absence every morning in the week. from the time that i\\nheard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me\\nthat he had some strong motive for securing the situation.”\\n\\n“but how could you guess what the motive was?”\\n\\n“had there been women in the house, i should have suspected a mere\\nvulgar intrigue. that, however, was out of the question. the man’s\\nbusiness was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\\ncould account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\\nas they were at. it must, then, be something out of the house. what\\ncould it be? i thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography, and\\nhis trick of vanishing into the cellar. the cellar! there was the end\\nof this tangled clue. then i made inquiries as to this mysterious\\nassistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most\\ndaring criminals in london. he was doing something in the\\ncellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. what\\ncould it be, once more? i could think of nothing save that he was\\nrunning a tunnel to some other building.\\n\\n“so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action. i\\nsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. i was\\nascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. it\\nwas not in front. then i rang the bell, and, as i hoped, the assistant\\nanswered it. we have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes\\nupon each other before. i hardly looked at his face. his knees were\\nwhat i wished to see. you must yourself have remarked how worn,\\nwrinkled, and stained they were. they spoke of those hours of\\nburrowing. the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. i\\nwalked round the corner, saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our\\nfriend’s premises, and felt that i had solved my problem. when you\\ndrove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the\\nchairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\\n\\n“and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” i\\nasked.\\n\\n“well, when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they\\ncared no longer about mr. jabez wilson’s presence—in other words, that\\nthey had completed their tunnel. but it was essential that they should\\nuse it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be\\nremoved. saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\\nwould give them two days for their escape. for all these reasons i\\nexpected them to come to-night.”\\n\\n“you reasoned it out beautifully,” i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.\\n“it is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\\n\\n“it saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “alas! i already feel\\nit closing in upon me. my life is spent in one long effort to escape\\nfrom the commonplaces of existence. these little problems help me to do\\nso.”\\n\\n“and you are a benefactor of the race,” said i.\\n\\nhe shrugged his shoulders. “well, perhaps, after all, it is of some\\nlittle use,” he remarked. “‘_l’homme c’est rien—l’œuvre c’est tout_,’\\nas gustave flaubert wrote to george sand.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\niii. a case of identity\\n\\n\\n“my dear fellow,” said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the\\nfire in his lodgings at baker street, “life is infinitely stranger than\\nanything which the mind of man could invent. we would not dare to\\nconceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. if\\nwe could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great\\ncity, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which\\nare going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the\\ncross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\\ngenerations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all\\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale\\nand unprofitable.”\\n\\n“and yet i am not convinced of it,” i answered. “the cases which come\\nto light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.\\nwe have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and\\nyet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\\nartistic.”\\n\\n“a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\\nrealistic effect,” remarked holmes. “this is wanting in the police\\nreport, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the\\nmagistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the\\nvital essence of the whole matter. depend upon it, there is nothing so\\nunnatural as the commonplace.”\\n\\ni smiled and shook my head. “i can quite understand your thinking so,”\\ni said. “of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper\\nto everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,\\nyou are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. but\\nhere”—i picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it to a\\npractical test. here is the first heading upon which i come. ‘a\\nhusband’s cruelty to his wife.’ there is half a column of print, but i\\nknow without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. there\\nis, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the\\nbruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. the crudest of writers\\ncould invent nothing more crude.”\\n\\n“indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,” said\\nholmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “this is the\\ndundas separation case, and, as it happens, i was engaged in clearing\\nup some small points in connection with it. the husband was a\\nteetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was\\nthat he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking\\nout his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will\\nallow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\\naverage story-teller. take a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge\\nthat i have scored over you in your example.”\\n\\nhe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the\\ncentre of the lid. its splendour was in such contrast to his homely\\nways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it.\\n\\n“ah,” said he, “i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks. it is\\na little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance\\nin the case of the irene adler papers.”\\n\\n“and the ring?” i asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\\nsparkled upon his finger.\\n\\n“it was from the reigning family of holland, though the matter in which\\ni served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to\\nyou, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little\\nproblems.”\\n\\n“and have you any on hand just now?” i asked with interest.\\n\\n“some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.\\nthey are important, you understand, without being interesting. indeed,\\ni have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a\\nfield for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and\\neffect which gives the charm to an investigation. the larger crimes are\\napt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a\\nrule, is the motive. in these cases, save for one rather intricate\\nmatter which has been referred to me from marseilles, there is nothing\\nwhich presents any features of interest. it is possible, however, that\\ni may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this\\nis one of my clients, or i am much mistaken.”\\n\\nhe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds\\ngazing down into the dull neutral-tinted london street. looking over\\nhis shoulder, i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large\\nwoman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red\\nfeather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess\\nof devonshire fashion over her ear. from under this great panoply she\\npeeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her\\nbody oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her\\nglove buttons. suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves\\nthe bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of\\nthe bell.\\n\\n“i have seen those symptoms before,” said holmes, throwing his\\ncigarette into the fire. “oscillation upon the pavement always means an\\n_affaire de cœur_. she would like advice, but is not sure that the\\nmatter is not too delicate for communication. and yet even here we may\\ndiscriminate. when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\\nlonger oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. here we\\nmay take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\\nmuch angry as perplexed, or grieved. but here she comes in person to\\nresolve our doubts.”\\n\\nas he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered\\nto announce miss mary sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind\\nhis small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny\\npilot boat. sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\\nwhich he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into\\nan armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted\\nfashion which was peculiar to him.\\n\\n“do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little\\ntrying to do so much typewriting?”\\n\\n“i did at first,” she answered, “but now i know where the letters are\\nwithout looking.” then, suddenly realising the full purport of his\\nwords, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. “you’ve heard about\\nme, mr. holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all that?”\\n\\n“never mind,” said holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things.\\nperhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook. if not, why\\nshould you come to consult me?”\\n\\n“i came to you, sir, because i heard of you from mrs. etherege, whose\\nhusband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up\\nfor dead. oh, mr. holmes, i wish you would do as much for me. i’m not\\nrich, but still i have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the\\nlittle that i make by the machine, and i would give it all to know what\\nhas become of mr. hosmer angel.”\\n\\n“why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked sherlock\\nholmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.\\n\\nagain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary\\nsutherland. “yes, i did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it made\\nme angry to see the easy way in which mr. windibank—that is, my\\nfather—took it all. he would not go to the police, and he would not go\\nto you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that\\nthere was no harm done, it made me mad, and i just on with my things\\nand came right away to you.”\\n\\n“your father,” said holmes, “your stepfather, surely, since the name is\\ndifferent.”\\n\\n“yes, my stepfather. i call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\\nfor he is only five years and two months older than myself.”\\n\\n“and your mother is alive?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, mother is alive and well. i wasn’t best pleased, mr. holmes,\\nwhen she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was\\nnearly fifteen years younger than herself. father was a plumber in the\\ntottenham court road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\\nmother carried on with mr. hardy, the foreman; but when mr. windibank\\ncame he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\\ntraveller in wines. they got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest,\\nwhich wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been\\nalive.”\\n\\ni had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with\\nthe greatest concentration of attention.\\n\\n“your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\\n\\n“oh, no, sir. it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in\\nauckland. it is in new zealand stock, paying 4½ per cent. two thousand\\nfive hundred pounds was the amount, but i can only touch the interest.”\\n\\n“you interest me extremely,” said holmes. “and since you draw so large\\na sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\\ndoubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. i believe that\\na single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £ 60.”\\n\\n“i could do with much less than that, mr. holmes, but you understand\\nthat as long as i live at home i don’t wish to be a burden to them, and\\nso they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them. of\\ncourse, that is only just for the time. mr. windibank draws my interest\\nevery quarter and pays it over to mother, and i find that i can do\\npretty well with what i earn at typewriting. it brings me twopence a\\nsheet, and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\\n\\n“you have made your position very clear to me,” said holmes. “this is\\nmy friend, dr. watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before\\nmyself. kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr. hosmer\\nangel.”\\n\\na flush stole over miss sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at\\nthe fringe of her jacket. “i met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,”\\nshe said. “they used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then\\nafterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. mr. windibank\\ndid not wish us to go. he never did wish us to go anywhere. he would\\nget quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday-school treat. but\\nthis time i was set on going, and i would go; for what right had he to\\nprevent? he said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\\nfather’s friends were to be there. and he said that i had nothing fit\\nto wear, when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken\\nout of the drawer. at last, when nothing else would do, he went off to\\nfrance upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and i, with\\nmr. hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there i met mr.\\nhosmer angel.”\\n\\n“i suppose,” said holmes, “that when mr. windibank came back from\\nfrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\\n\\n“oh, well, he was very good about it. he laughed, i remember, and\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\\nwoman, for she would have her way.”\\n\\n“i see. then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as i understand, a\\ngentleman called mr. hosmer angel.”\\n\\n“yes, sir. i met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we\\nhad got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, mr.\\nholmes, i met him twice for walks, but after that father came back\\nagain, and mr. hosmer angel could not come to the house any more.”\\n\\n“no?”\\n\\n“well, you know father didn’t like anything of the sort. he wouldn’t\\nhave any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman\\nshould be happy in her own family circle. but then, as i used to say to\\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and i had not got\\nmine yet.”\\n\\n“but how about mr. hosmer angel? did he make no attempt to see you?”\\n\\n“well, father was going off to france again in a week, and hosmer wrote\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until\\nhe had gone. we could write in the meantime, and he used to write every\\nday. i took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for\\nfather to know.”\\n\\n“were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\\n\\n“oh, yes, mr. holmes. we were engaged after the first walk that we\\ntook. hosmer—mr. angel—was a cashier in an office in leadenhall\\nstreet—and—”\\n\\n“what office?”\\n\\n“that’s the worst of it, mr. holmes, i don’t know.”\\n\\n“where did he live, then?”\\n\\n“he slept on the premises.”\\n\\n“and you don’t know his address?”\\n\\n“no—except that it was leadenhall street.”\\n\\n“where did you address your letters, then?”\\n\\n“to the leadenhall street post office, to be left till called for. he\\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so i offered to\\ntypewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he said\\nthat when i wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were\\ntypewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. that\\nwill just show you how fond he was of me, mr. holmes, and the little\\nthings that he would think of.”\\n\\n“it was most suggestive,” said holmes. “it has long been an axiom of\\nmine that the little things are infinitely the most important. can you\\nremember any other little things about mr. hosmer angel?”\\n\\n“he was a very shy man, mr. holmes. he would rather walk with me in the\\nevening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be\\nconspicuous. very retiring and gentlemanly he was. even his voice was\\ngentle. he’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\\ntold me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\\nwhispering fashion of speech. he was always well dressed, very neat and\\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted\\nglasses against the glare.”\\n\\n“well, and what happened when mr. windibank, your stepfather, returned\\nto france?”\\n\\n“mr. hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should\\nmarry before father came back. he was in dreadful earnest and made me\\nswear, with my hands on the testament, that whatever happened i would\\nalways be true to him. mother said he was quite right to make me swear,\\nand that it was a sign of his passion. mother was all in his favour\\nfrom the first and was even fonder of him than i was. then, when they\\ntalked of marrying within the week, i began to ask about father; but\\nthey both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him\\nafterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. i\\ndidn’t quite like that, mr. holmes. it seemed funny that i should ask\\nhis leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but i didn’t want\\nto do anything on the sly, so i wrote to father at bordeaux, where the\\ncompany has its french offices, but the letter came back to me on the\\nvery morning of the wedding.”\\n\\n“it missed him, then?”\\n\\n“yes, sir; for he had started to england just before it arrived.”\\n\\n“ha! that was unfortunate. your wedding was arranged, then, for the\\nfriday. was it to be in church?”\\n\\n“yes, sir, but very quietly. it was to be at st. saviour’s, near king’s\\ncross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st. pancras\\nhotel. hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he\\nput us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\\nhappened to be the only other cab in the street. we got to the church\\nfirst, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\\nlooked there was no one there! the cabman said that he could not\\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\\neyes. that was last friday, mr. holmes, and i have never seen or heard\\nanything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\\n\\n“it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said\\nholmes.\\n\\n“oh, no, sir! he was too good and kind to leave me so. why, all the\\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, i was to be true;\\nand that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, i\\nwas always to remember that i was pledged to him, and that he would\\nclaim his pledge sooner or later. it seemed strange talk for a\\nwedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\\n\\n“most certainly it does. your own opinion is, then, that some\\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. i believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\\nhave talked so. and then i think that what he foresaw happened.”\\n\\n“but you have no notion as to what it could have been?”\\n\\n“none.”\\n\\n“one more question. how did your mother take the matter?”\\n\\n“she was angry, and said that i was never to speak of the matter\\nagain.”\\n\\n“and your father? did you tell him?”\\n\\n“yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\\nthat i should hear of hosmer again. as he said, what interest could\\nanyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving\\nme? now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\\nmy money settled on him, there might be some reason, but hosmer was\\nvery independent about money and never would look at a shilling of\\nmine. and yet, what could have happened? and why could he not write?\\noh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and i can’t sleep a wink at\\nnight.” she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to\\nsob heavily into it.\\n\\n“i shall glance into the case for you,” said holmes, rising, “and i\\nhave no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. let the weight\\nof the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it\\nfurther. above all, try to let mr. hosmer angel vanish from your\\nmemory, as he has done from your life.”\\n\\n“then you don’t think i’ll see him again?”\\n\\n“i fear not.”\\n\\n“then what has happened to him?”\\n\\n“you will leave that question in my hands. i should like an accurate\\ndescription of him and any letters of his which you can spare.”\\n\\n“i advertised for him in last saturday’s _chronicle_,” said she. “here\\nis the slip and here are four letters from him.”\\n\\n“thank you. and your address?”\\n\\n“no. 31 lyon place, camberwell.”\\n\\n“mr. angel’s address you never had, i understand. where is your\\nfather’s place of business?”\\n\\n“he travels for westhouse & marbank, the great claret importers of\\nfenchurch street.”\\n\\n“thank you. you have made your statement very clearly. you will leave\\nthe papers here, and remember the advice which i have given you. let\\nthe whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your\\nlife.”\\n\\n“you are very kind, mr. holmes, but i cannot do that. i shall be true\\nto hosmer. he shall find me ready when he comes back.”\\n\\nfor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.\\nshe laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way,\\nwith a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\n\\nsherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still\\npressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze\\ndirected upward to the ceiling. then he took down from the rack the old\\nand oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit\\nit, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths\\nspinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\\n\\n“quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “i found her\\nmore interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather\\na trite one. you will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\\nandover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at the hague last\\nyear. old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which\\nwere new to me. but the maiden herself was most instructive.”\\n\\n“you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\nme,” i remarked.\\n\\n“not invisible but unnoticed, watson. you did not know where to look,\\nand so you missed all that was important. i can never bring you to\\nrealise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,\\nor the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. now, what did you\\ngather from that woman’s appearance? describe it.”\\n\\n“well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a\\nfeather of a brickish red. her jacket was black, with black beads sewn\\nupon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. her dress was\\nbrown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at\\nthe neck and sleeves. her gloves were greyish and were worn through at\\nthe right forefinger. her boots i didn’t observe. she had small round,\\nhanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in\\na vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\\n\\nsherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\n\\n“’pon my word, watson, you are coming along wonderfully. you have\\nreally done very well indeed. it is true that you have missed\\neverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\\nhave a quick eye for colour. never trust to general impressions, my\\nboy, but concentrate yourself upon details. my first glance is always\\nat a woman’s sleeve. in a man it is perhaps better first to take the\\nknee of the trouser. as you observe, this woman had plush upon her\\nsleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. the double\\nline a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against\\nthe table, was beautifully defined. the sewing-machine, of the hand\\ntype, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side\\nof it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the\\nbroadest part, as this was. i then glanced at her face, and, observing\\nthe dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, i ventured a remark\\nupon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.”\\n\\n“it surprised me.”\\n\\n“but, surely, it was obvious. i was then much surprised and interested\\non glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was\\nwearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one\\nhaving a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. one was\\nbuttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at\\nthe first, third, and fifth. now, when you see that a young lady,\\notherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,\\nhalf-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a\\nhurry.”\\n\\n“and what else?” i asked, keenly interested, as i always was, by my\\nfriend’s incisive reasoning.\\n\\n“i noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home\\nbut after being fully dressed. you observed that her right glove was\\ntorn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove\\nand finger were stained with violet ink. she had written in a hurry and\\ndipped her pen too deep. it must have been this morning, or the mark\\nwould not remain clear upon the finger. all this is amusing, though\\nrather elementary, but i must go back to business, watson. would you\\nmind reading me the advertised description of mr. hosmer angel?”\\n\\ni held the little printed slip to the light. “missing,” it said, “on\\nthe morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named hosmer angel. about\\nfive ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black\\nhair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and\\nmoustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. was dressed,\\nwhen last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,\\ngold albert chain, and grey harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters\\nover elastic-sided boots. known to have been employed in an office in\\nleadenhall street. anybody bringing,” &c, &c.\\n\\n“that will do,” said holmes. “as to the letters,” he continued,\\nglancing over them, “they are very commonplace. absolutely no clue in\\nthem to mr. angel, save that he quotes balzac once. there is one\\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\\n\\n“they are typewritten,” i remarked.\\n\\n“not only that, but the signature is typewritten. look at the neat\\nlittle ‘hosmer angel’ at the bottom. there is a date, you see, but no\\nsuperscription except leadenhall street, which is rather vague. the\\npoint about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it\\nconclusive.”\\n\\n“of what?”\\n\\n“my dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears\\nupon the case?”\\n\\n“i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to\\ndeny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\\n\\n“no, that was not the point. however, i shall write two letters, which\\nshould settle the matter. one is to a firm in the city, the other is to\\nthe young lady’s stepfather, mr. windibank, asking him whether he could\\nmeet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. it is just as well that\\nwe should do business with the male relatives. and now, doctor, we can\\ndo nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our\\nlittle problem upon the shelf for the interim.”\\n\\ni had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of\\nreasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must\\nhave some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which\\nhe treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to\\nfathom. once only had i known him to fail, in the case of the king of\\nbohemia and of the irene adler photograph; but when i looked back to\\nthe weird business of the sign of four, and the extraordinary\\ncircumstances connected with the study in scarlet, i felt that it would\\nbe a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\n\\ni left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\nconviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that\\nhe held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity\\nof the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland.\\n\\na professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at\\nthe time, and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the\\nsufferer. it was not until close upon six o’clock that i found myself\\nfree and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street,\\nhalf afraid that i might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of\\nthe little mystery. i found sherlock holmes alone, however, half\\nasleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\\narmchair. a formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\\npungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent\\nhis day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\n\\n“well, have you solved it?” i asked as i entered.\\n\\n“yes. it was the bisulphate of baryta.”\\n\\n“no, no, the mystery!” i cried.\\n\\n“oh, that! i thought of the salt that i have been working upon. there\\nwas never any mystery in the matter, though, as i said yesterday, some\\nof the details are of interest. the only drawback is that there is no\\nlaw, i fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”\\n\\n“who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting miss\\nsutherland?”\\n\\nthe question was hardly out of my mouth, and holmes had not yet opened\\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a\\ntap at the door.\\n\\n“this is the girl’s stepfather, mr. james windibank,” said holmes. “he\\nhas written to me to say that he would be here at six. come in!”\\n\\nthe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty\\nyears of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,\\ninsinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating\\ngrey eyes. he shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny\\ntop-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the\\nnearest chair.\\n\\n“good-evening, mr. james windibank,” said holmes. “i think that this\\ntypewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\\nme for six o’clock?”\\n\\n“yes, sir. i am afraid that i am a little late, but i am not quite my\\nown master, you know. i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you\\nabout this little matter, for i think it is far better not to wash\\nlinen of the sort in public. it was quite against my wishes that she\\ncame, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have\\nnoticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind\\non a point. of course, i did not mind you so much, as you are not\\nconnected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a\\nfamily misfortune like this noised abroad. besides, it is a useless\\nexpense, for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel?”\\n\\n“on the contrary,” said holmes quietly; “i have every reason to believe\\nthat i will succeed in discovering mr. hosmer angel.”\\n\\nmr. windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. “i am\\ndelighted to hear it,” he said.\\n\\n“it is a curious thing,” remarked holmes, “that a typewriter has really\\nquite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. unless they are\\nquite new, no two of them write exactly alike. some letters get more\\nworn than others, and some wear only on one side. now, you remark in\\nthis note of yours, mr. windibank, that in every case there is some\\nlittle slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the\\n‘r.’ there are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\\nobvious.”\\n\\n“we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\\ndoubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\\nholmes with his bright little eyes.\\n\\n“and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study, mr.\\nwindibank,” holmes continued. “i think of writing another little\\nmonograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to\\ncrime. it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention. i\\nhave here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. they\\nare all typewritten. in each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred and\\nthe ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which i\\nhave alluded are there as well.”\\n\\nmr. windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. “i cannot\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, mr. holmes,” he said. “if\\nyou can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\\nit.”\\n\\n“certainly,” said holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\\ndoor. “i let you know, then, that i have caught him!”\\n\\n“what! where?” shouted mr. windibank, turning white to his lips and\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\n\\n“oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said holmes suavely. “there is no\\npossible getting out of it, mr. windibank. it is quite too transparent,\\nand it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible\\nfor me to solve so simple a question. that’s right! sit down and let us\\ntalk it over.”\\n\\nour visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter\\nof moisture on his brow. “it—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.\\n\\n“i am very much afraid that it is not. but between ourselves,\\nwindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty\\nway as ever came before me. now, let me just run over the course of\\nevents, and you will contradict me if i go wrong.”\\n\\nthe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\\nbreast, like one who is utterly crushed. holmes stuck his feet up on\\nthe corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his\\npockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\n\\n“the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,”\\nsaid he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long\\nas she lived with them. it was a considerable sum, for people in their\\nposition, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. it\\nwas worth an effort to preserve it. the daughter was of a good, amiable\\ndisposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it\\nwas evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little\\nincome, she would not be allowed to remain single long. now her\\nmarriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what\\ndoes her stepfather do to prevent it? he takes the obvious course of\\nkeeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of\\nher own age. but soon he found that that would not answer forever. she\\nbecame restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her\\npositive intention of going to a certain ball. what does her clever\\nstepfather do then? he conceives an idea more creditable to his head\\nthan to his heart. with the connivance and assistance of his wife he\\ndisguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked\\nthe face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear\\nvoice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\\ngirl’s short sight, he appears as mr. hosmer angel, and keeps off other\\nlovers by making love himself.”\\n\\n“it was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “we never thought\\nthat she would have been so carried away.”\\n\\n“very likely not. however that may be, the young lady was very\\ndecidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her\\nstepfather was in france, the suspicion of treachery never for an\\ninstant entered her mind. she was flattered by the gentleman’s\\nattentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed\\nadmiration of her mother. then mr. angel began to call, for it was\\nobvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a\\nreal effect were to be produced. there were meetings, and an\\nengagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from\\nturning towards anyone else. but the deception could not be kept up\\nforever. these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous. the\\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\\ndramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the\\nyoung lady’s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\\nfor some time to come. hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a\\ntestament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding. james windibank wished\\nmiss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel, and so uncertain as to\\nhis fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\\nto another man. as far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\\nhe could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\\nof stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. i\\nthink that was the chain of events, mr. windibank!”\\n\\nour visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had\\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his\\npale face.\\n\\n“it may be so, or it may not, mr. holmes,” said he, “but if you are so\\nvery sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are\\nbreaking the law now, and not me. i have done nothing actionable from\\nthe first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself\\nopen to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”\\n\\n“the law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said holmes, unlocking and\\nthrowing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved\\npunishment more. if the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought\\nto lay a whip across your shoulders. by jove!” he continued, flushing\\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not\\npart of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and i\\nthink i shall just treat myself to—” he took two swift steps to the\\nwhip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps\\nupon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we\\ncould see mr. james windibank running at the top of his speed down the\\nroad.\\n\\n“there’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said holmes, laughing, as he threw\\nhimself down into his chair once more. “that fellow will rise from\\ncrime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\\nthe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\\n\\n“i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” i\\nremarked.\\n\\n“well, of course it was obvious from the first that this mr. hosmer\\nangel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was\\nequally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as\\nfar as we could see, was the stepfather. then the fact that the two men\\nwere never together, but that the one always appeared when the other\\nwas away, was suggestive. so were the tinted spectacles and the curious\\nvoice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. my\\nsuspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his\\nsignature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so\\nfamiliar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of\\nit. you see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,\\nall pointed in the same direction.”\\n\\n“and how did you verify them?”\\n\\n“having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. i knew\\nthe firm for which this man worked. having taken the printed\\ndescription. i eliminated everything from it which could be the result\\nof a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and i sent it to\\nthe firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered\\nto the description of any of their travellers. i had already noticed\\nthe peculiarities of the typewriter, and i wrote to the man himself at\\nhis business address asking him if he would come here. as i expected,\\nhis reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but\\ncharacteristic defects. the same post brought me a letter from\\nwesthouse & marbank, of fenchurch street, to say that the description\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employé, james windibank.\\n_voilà tout_!”\\n\\n“and miss sutherland?”\\n\\n“if i tell her she will not believe me. you may remember the old\\npersian saying, ‘there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and\\ndanger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ there is as\\nmuch sense in hafiz as in horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\niv. the boscombe valley mystery\\n\\n\\nwe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and i, when the maid\\nbrought in a telegram. it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way:\\n\\n“have you a couple of days to spare? have just been wired for from the\\nwest of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy. shall be\\nglad if you will come with me. air and scenery perfect. leave\\npaddington by the 11:15.”\\n\\n“what do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me. “will you\\ngo?”\\n\\n“i really don’t know what to say. i have a fairly long list at\\npresent.”\\n\\n“oh, anstruther would do your work for you. you have been looking a\\nlittle pale lately. i think that the change would do you good, and you\\nare always so interested in mr. sherlock holmes’ cases.”\\n\\n“i should be ungrateful if i were not, seeing what i gained through one\\nof them,” i answered. “but if i am to go, i must pack at once, for i\\nhave only half an hour.”\\n\\nmy experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect\\nof making me a prompt and ready traveller. my wants were few and\\nsimple, so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my\\nvalise, rattling away to paddington station. sherlock holmes was pacing\\nup and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and\\ntaller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\n\\n“it is really very good of you to come, watson,” said he. “it makes a\\nconsiderable difference to me, having someone with me on whom i can\\nthoroughly rely. local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.\\nif you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets.”\\n\\nwe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers\\nwhich holmes had brought with him. among these he rummaged and read,\\nwith intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past\\nreading. then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and\\ntossed them up onto the rack.\\n\\n“have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.\\n\\n“not a word. i have not seen a paper for some days.”\\n\\n“the london press has not had very full accounts. i have just been\\nlooking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\nparticulars. it seems, from what i gather, to be one of those simple\\ncases which are so extremely difficult.”\\n\\n“that sounds a little paradoxical.”\\n\\n“but it is profoundly true. singularity is almost invariably a clue.\\nthe more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it\\nis to bring it home. in this case, however, they have established a\\nvery serious case against the son of the murdered man.”\\n\\n“it is a murder, then?”\\n\\n“well, it is conjectured to be so. i shall take nothing for granted\\nuntil i have the opportunity of looking personally into it. i will\\nexplain the state of things to you, as far as i have been able to\\nunderstand it, in a very few words.\\n\\n“boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross, in\\nherefordshire. the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr. john\\nturner, who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to\\nthe old country. one of the farms which he held, that of hatherley, was\\nlet to mr. charles mccarthy, who was also an ex-australian. the men had\\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that\\nwhen they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as\\npossible. turner was apparently the richer man, so mccarthy became his\\ntenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as\\nthey were frequently together. mccarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen,\\nand turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them\\nhad wives living. they appear to have avoided the society of the\\nneighbouring english families and to have led retired lives, though\\nboth the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the\\nrace-meetings of the neighbourhood. mccarthy kept two servants—a man\\nand a girl. turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the\\nleast. that is as much as i have been able to gather about the\\nfamilies. now for the facts.\\n\\n“on june 3rd, that is, on monday last, mccarthy left his house at\\nhatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe\\npool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream\\nwhich runs down the boscombe valley. he had been out with his\\nserving-man in the morning at ross, and he had told the man that he\\nmust hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.\\nfrom that appointment he never came back alive.\\n\\n“from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile,\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. one was an old\\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was william crowder,\\na game-keeper in the employ of mr. turner. both these witnesses depose\\nthat mr. mccarthy was walking alone. the game-keeper adds that within a\\nfew minutes of his seeing mr. mccarthy pass he had seen his son, mr.\\njames mccarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. to the\\nbest of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and\\nthe son was following him. he thought no more of the matter until he\\nheard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\n\\n“the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. the boscombe pool is thickly wooded\\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. a girl\\nof fourteen, patience moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of\\nthe boscombe valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.\\nshe states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood\\nand close by the lake, mr. mccarthy and his son, and that they appeared\\nto be having a violent quarrel. she heard mr. mccarthy the elder using\\nvery strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his\\nhand as if to strike his father. she was so frightened by their\\nviolence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home\\nthat she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool, and\\nthat she was afraid that they were going to fight. she had hardly said\\nthe words when young mr. mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say\\nthat he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\\nof the lodge-keeper. he was much excited, without either his gun or his\\nhat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with\\nfresh blood. on following him they found the dead body stretched out\\nupon the grass beside the pool. the head had been beaten in by repeated\\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. the injuries were such as might\\nvery well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which\\nwas found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. under\\nthese circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict\\nof ‘wilful murder’ having been returned at the inquest on tuesday, he\\nwas on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross, who have\\nreferred the case to the next assizes. those are the main facts of the\\ncase as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.”\\n\\n“i could hardly imagine a more damning case,” i remarked. “if ever\\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”\\n\\n“circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered holmes\\nthoughtfully. “it may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in\\nan equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. it\\nmust be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave\\nagainst the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the\\nculprit. there are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and\\namong them miss turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who\\nbelieve in his innocence, and who have retained lestrade, whom you may\\nrecollect in connection with the study in scarlet, to work out the case\\nin his interest. lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case\\nto me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying\\nwestward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their\\nbreakfasts at home.”\\n\\n“i am afraid,” said i, “that the facts are so obvious that you will\\nfind little credit to be gained out of this case.”\\n\\n“there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,\\nlaughing. “besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to mr. lestrade. you know me\\ntoo well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either\\nconfirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of\\nemploying, or even of understanding. to take the first example to hand,\\ni very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the\\nright-hand side, and yet i question whether mr. lestrade would have\\nnoted even so self-evident a thing as that.”\\n\\n“how on earth—”\\n\\n“my dear fellow, i know you well. i know the military neatness which\\ncharacterises you. you shave every morning, and in this season you\\nshave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete\\nas we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively\\nslovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear\\nthat that side is less illuminated than the other. i could not imagine\\na man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being\\nsatisfied with such a result. i only quote this as a trivial example of\\nobservation and inference. therein lies my _métier_, and it is just\\npossible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies\\nbefore us. there are one or two minor points which were brought out in\\nthe inquest, and which are worth considering.”\\n\\n“what are they?”\\n\\n“it appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\\nreturn to hatherley farm. on the inspector of constabulary informing\\nhim that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to\\nhear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. this observation of\\nhis had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might\\nhave remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”\\n\\n“it was a confession,” i ejaculated.\\n\\n“no, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”\\n\\n“coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least\\na most suspicious remark.”\\n\\n“on the contrary,” said holmes, “it is the brightest rift which i can\\nat present see in the clouds. however innocent he might be, he could\\nnot be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\\nwere very black against him. had he appeared surprised at his own\\narrest, or feigned indignation at it, i should have looked upon it as\\nhighly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\\nunder the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to\\na scheming man. his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\\neither an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\\nand firmness. as to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his\\nfather, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far\\nforgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\\nhis hand as if to strike him. the self-reproach and contrition which\\nare displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy\\nmind rather than of a guilty one.”\\n\\ni shook my head. “many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,”\\ni remarked.\\n\\n“so they have. and many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\\n\\n“what is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\\n\\n“it is, i am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though\\nthere are one or two points in it which are suggestive. you will find\\nit here, and may read it for yourself.”\\n\\nhe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper,\\nand having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which\\nthe unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had\\noccurred. i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read\\nit very carefully. it ran in this way:\\n\\n“mr. james mccarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and\\ngave evidence as follows: ‘i had been away from home for three days at\\nbristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday,\\nthe 3rd. my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and\\ni was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john\\ncobb, the groom. shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap\\nin the yard, and, looking out of my window, i saw him get out and walk\\nrapidly out of the yard, though i was not aware in which direction he\\nwas going. i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the\\nboscombe pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which\\nis upon the other side. on my way i saw william crowder, the\\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in\\nthinking that i was following my father. i had no idea that he was in\\nfront of me. when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of\\n“cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. i then\\nhurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. he appeared to be\\nmuch surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was\\ndoing there. a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost\\nto blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. seeing that\\nhis passion was becoming ungovernable, i left him and returned towards\\nhatherley farm. i had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when i\\nheard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. i\\nfound my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly\\ninjured. i dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost\\ninstantly expired. i knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made\\nmy way to mr. turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to\\nask for assistance. i saw no one near my father when i returned, and i\\nhave no idea how he came by his injuries. he was not a popular man,\\nbeing somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far\\nas i know, no active enemies. i know nothing further of the matter.’\\n\\n“the coroner: did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\n\\n“witness: he mumbled a few words, but i could only catch some allusion\\nto a rat.\\n\\n“the coroner: what did you understand by that?\\n\\n“witness: it conveyed no meaning to me. i thought that he was\\ndelirious.\\n\\n“the coroner: what was the point upon which you and your father had\\nthis final quarrel?\\n\\n“witness: i should prefer not to answer.\\n\\n“the coroner: i am afraid that i must press it.\\n\\n“witness: it is really impossible for me to tell you. i can assure you\\nthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\n\\n“the coroner: that is for the court to decide. i need not point out to\\nyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably\\nin any future proceedings which may arise.\\n\\n“witness: i must still refuse.\\n\\n“the coroner: i understand that the cry of ‘cooee’ was a common signal\\nbetween you and your father?\\n\\n“witness: it was.\\n\\n“the coroner: how was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,\\nand before he even knew that you had returned from bristol?\\n\\n“witness (with considerable confusion): i do not know.\\n\\n“a juryman: did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you\\nreturned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?\\n\\n“witness: nothing definite.\\n\\n“the coroner: what do you mean?\\n\\n“witness: i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open,\\nthat i could think of nothing except of my father. yet i have a vague\\nimpression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the\\nleft of me. it seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of\\nsome sort, or a plaid perhaps. when i rose from my father i looked\\nround for it, but it was gone.\\n\\n“‘do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’\\n\\n“‘yes, it was gone.’\\n\\n“  ‘you cannot say what it was?’\\n\\n“‘no, i had a feeling something was there.’\\n\\n“‘how far from the body?’\\n\\n“‘a dozen yards or so.’\\n\\n“‘and how far from the edge of the wood?’\\n\\n“‘about the same.’\\n\\n“‘then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of\\nit?’\\n\\n“‘yes, but with my back towards it.’\\n\\n“this concluded the examination of the witness.”\\n\\n“i see,” said i as i glanced down the column, “that the coroner in his\\nconcluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy. he calls\\nattention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details\\nof his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his\\nfather’s dying words. they are all, as he remarks, very much against\\nthe son.”\\n\\nholmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the\\ncushioned seat. “both you and the coroner have been at some pains,”\\nsaid he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s\\nfavour. don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having\\ntoo much imagination and too little? too little, if he could not invent\\na cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too\\nmuch, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so\\n_outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the\\nvanishing cloth. no, sir, i shall approach this case from the point of\\nview that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither\\nthat hypothesis will lead us. and now here is my pocket petrarch, and\\nnot another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of\\naction. we lunch at swindon, and i see that we shall be there in twenty\\nminutes.”\\n\\nit was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through the\\nbeautiful stroud valley, and over the broad gleaming severn, found\\nourselves at the pretty little country-town of ross. a lean,\\nferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the\\nplatform. in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings\\nwhich he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, i had no\\ndifficulty in recognising lestrade, of scotland yard. with him we drove\\nto the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us.\\n\\n“i have ordered a carriage,” said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.\\n“i knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until\\nyou had been on the scene of the crime.”\\n\\n“it was very nice and complimentary of you,” holmes answered. “it is\\nentirely a question of barometric pressure.”\\n\\nlestrade looked startled. “i do not quite follow,” he said.\\n\\n“how is the glass? twenty-nine, i see. no wind, and not a cloud in the\\nsky. i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the\\nsofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. i do\\nnot think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage to-night.”\\n\\nlestrade laughed indulgently. “you have, no doubt, already formed your\\nconclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “the case is as plain as a\\npikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. still,\\nof course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.\\nshe has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though i repeatedly\\ntold her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not\\nalready done. why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\\n\\nhe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most\\nlovely young women that i have ever seen in my life. her violet eyes\\nshining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of\\nher natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\\n\\n“oh, mr. sherlock holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other of\\nus, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my\\ncompanion, “i am so glad that you have come. i have driven down to tell\\nyou so. i know that james didn’t do it. i know it, and i want you to\\nstart upon your work knowing it, too. never let yourself doubt upon\\nthat point. we have known each other since we were little children, and\\ni know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to\\nhurt a fly. such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.”\\n\\n“i hope we may clear him, miss turner,” said sherlock holmes. “you may\\nrely upon my doing all that i can.”\\n\\n“but you have read the evidence. you have formed some conclusion? do\\nyou not see some loophole, some flaw? do you not yourself think that he\\nis innocent?”\\n\\n“i think that it is very probable.”\\n\\n“there, now!” she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly\\nat lestrade. “you hear! he gives me hopes.”\\n\\nlestrade shrugged his shoulders. “i am afraid that my colleague has\\nbeen a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.\\n\\n“but he is right. oh! i know that he is right. james never did it. and\\nabout his quarrel with his father, i am sure that the reason why he\\nwould not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in\\nit.”\\n\\n“in what way?” asked holmes.\\n\\n“it is no time for me to hide anything. james and his father had many\\ndisagreements about me. mr. mccarthy was very anxious that there should\\nbe a marriage between us. james and i have always loved each other as\\nbrother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little\\nof life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything\\nlike that yet. so there were quarrels, and this, i am sure, was one of\\nthem.”\\n\\n“and your father?” asked holmes. “was he in favour of such a union?”\\n\\n“no, he was averse to it also. no one but mr. mccarthy was in favour of\\nit.” a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one\\nof his keen, questioning glances at her.\\n\\n“thank you for this information,” said he. “may i see your father if i\\ncall to-morrow?”\\n\\n“i am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\\n\\n“the doctor?”\\n\\n“yes, have you not heard? poor father has never been strong for years\\nback, but this has broken him down completely. he has taken to his bed,\\nand dr. willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is\\nshattered. mr. mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the\\nold days in victoria.”\\n\\n“ha! in victoria! that is important.”\\n\\n“yes, at the mines.”\\n\\n“quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as i understand, mr. turner made\\nhis money.”\\n\\n“yes, certainly.”\\n\\n“thank you, miss turner. you have been of material assistance to me.”\\n\\n“you will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. no doubt you will go\\nto the prison to see james. oh, if you do, mr. holmes, do tell him that\\ni know him to be innocent.”\\n\\n“i will, miss turner.”\\n\\n“i must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if i\\nleave him. good-bye, and god help you in your undertaking.” she hurried\\nfrom the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the\\nwheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\\n\\n“i am ashamed of you, holmes,” said lestrade with dignity after a few\\nminutes’ silence. “why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\\ndisappoint? i am not over-tender of heart, but i call it cruel.”\\n\\n“i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy,” said holmes.\\n“have you an order to see him in prison?”\\n\\n“yes, but only for you and me.”\\n\\n“then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out. we have still\\ntime to take a train to hereford and see him to-night?”\\n\\n“ample.”\\n\\n“then let us do so. watson, i fear that you will find it very slow, but\\ni shall only be away a couple of hours.”\\n\\ni walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the\\nstreets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where i lay\\nupon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.\\nthe puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the\\ndeep mystery through which we were groping, and i found my attention\\nwander so continually from the action to the fact, that i at last flung\\nit across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of\\nthe events of the day. supposing that this unhappy young man’s story\\nwere absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely\\nunforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the\\ntime when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by\\nhis screams, he rushed into the glade? it was something terrible and\\ndeadly. what could it be? might not the nature of the injuries reveal\\nsomething to my medical instincts? i rang the bell and called for the\\nweekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.\\nin the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of\\nthe left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\\nshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. i marked the spot upon\\nmy own head. clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.\\nthat was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen\\nquarrelling he was face to face with his father. still, it did not go\\nfor very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the\\nblow fell. still, it might be worth while to call holmes’ attention to\\nit. then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. what could\\nthat mean? it could not be delirium. a man dying from a sudden blow\\ndoes not commonly become delirious. no, it was more likely to be an\\nattempt to explain how he met his fate. but what could it indicate? i\\ncudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. and then the\\nincident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy. if that were true\\nthe murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\\novercoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and\\nto carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back\\nturned not a dozen paces off. what a tissue of mysteries and\\nimprobabilities the whole thing was! i did not wonder at lestrade’s\\nopinion, and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes’ insight that i\\ncould not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen\\nhis conviction of young mccarthy’s innocence.\\n\\nit was late before sherlock holmes returned. he came back alone, for\\nlestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\n\\n“the glass still keeps very high,” he remarked as he sat down. “it is\\nof importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the\\nground. on the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest\\nfor such nice work as that, and i did not wish to do it when fagged by\\na long journey. i have seen young mccarthy.”\\n\\n“and what did you learn from him?”\\n\\n“nothing.”\\n\\n“could he throw no light?”\\n\\n“none at all. i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had\\ndone it and was screening him or her, but i am convinced now that he is\\nas puzzled as everyone else. he is not a very quick-witted youth,\\nthough comely to look at and, i should think, sound at heart.”\\n\\n“i cannot admire his taste,” i remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that\\nhe was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss\\nturner.”\\n\\n“ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. this fellow is madly,\\ninsanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a\\nlad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at\\na boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of\\na barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office? no one knows a\\nword of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him\\nto be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do,\\nbut what he knows to be absolutely impossible. it was sheer frenzy of\\nthis sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his\\nfather, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to miss\\nturner. on the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and\\nhis father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown\\nhim over utterly had he known the truth. it was with his barmaid wife\\nthat he had spent the last three days in bristol, and his father did\\nnot know where he was. mark that point. it is of importance. good has\\ncome out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers\\nthat he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him\\nover utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband\\nalready in the bermuda dockyard, so that there is really no tie between\\nthem. i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all\\nthat he has suffered.”\\n\\n“but if he is innocent, who has done it?”\\n\\n“ah! who? i would call your attention very particularly to two points.\\none is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the\\npool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was\\naway, and he did not know when he would return. the second is that the\\nmurdered man was heard to cry ‘cooee!’ before he knew that his son had\\nreturned. those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. and\\nnow let us talk about george meredith, if you please, and we shall\\nleave all minor matters until to-morrow.”\\n\\nthere was no rain, as holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright\\nand cloudless. at nine o’clock lestrade called for us with the\\ncarriage, and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool.\\n\\n“there is serious news this morning,” lestrade observed. “it is said\\nthat mr. turner, of the hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”\\n\\n“an elderly man, i presume?” said holmes.\\n\\n“about sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\\nabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. this business\\nhas had a very bad effect upon him. he was an old friend of mccarthy’s,\\nand, i may add, a great benefactor to him, for i have learned that he\\ngave him hatherley farm rent free.”\\n\\n“indeed! that is interesting,” said holmes.\\n\\n“oh, yes! in a hundred other ways he has helped him. everybody about\\nhere speaks of his kindness to him.”\\n\\n“really! does it not strike you as a little singular that this\\nmccarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been\\nunder such obligations to turner, should still talk of marrying his son\\nto turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and\\nthat in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a\\nproposal and all else would follow? it is the more strange, since we\\nknow that turner himself was averse to the idea. the daughter told us\\nas much. do you not deduce something from that?”\\n\\n“we have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said lestrade,\\nwinking at me. “i find it hard enough to tackle facts, holmes, without\\nflying away after theories and fancies.”\\n\\n“you are right,” said holmes demurely; “you do find it very hard to\\ntackle the facts.”\\n\\n“anyhow, i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\\nget hold of,” replied lestrade with some warmth.\\n\\n“and that is—”\\n\\n“that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all\\ntheories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\\n\\n“well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said holmes, laughing.\\n“but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the\\nleft.”\\n\\n“yes, that is it.” it was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,\\ntwo-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\\nthe grey walls. the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\\ngave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay\\nheavy upon it. we called at the door, when the maid, at holmes’\\nrequest, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his\\ndeath, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had\\nthen had. having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\\ndifferent points, holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from\\nwhich we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool.\\n\\nsherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as\\nthis. men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker\\nstreet would have failed to recognise him. his face flushed and\\ndarkened. his brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his\\neyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. his face was\\nbent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\\nstood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. his nostrils seemed\\nto dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\\nabsolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or\\nremark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a\\nquick, impatient snarl in reply. swiftly and silently he made his way\\nalong the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the\\nwoods to the boscombe pool. it was damp, marshy ground, as is all that\\ndistrict, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and\\namid the short grass which bounded it on either side. sometimes holmes\\nwould hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little\\ndetour into the meadow. lestrade and i walked behind him, the detective\\nindifferent and contemptuous, while i watched my friend with the\\ninterest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions\\nwas directed towards a definite end.\\n\\nthe boscombe pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\\nfifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the hatherley\\nfarm and the private park of the wealthy mr. turner. above the woods\\nwhich lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\\npinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner’s dwelling. on\\nthe hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\\na narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\\nthe trees and the reeds which lined the lake. lestrade showed us the\\nexact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\\nthe ground, that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by\\nthe fall of the stricken man. to holmes, as i could see by his eager\\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\\ntrampled grass. he ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\\nthen turned upon my companion.\\n\\n“what did you go into the pool for?” he asked.\\n\\n“i fished about with a rake. i thought there might be some weapon or\\nother trace. but how on earth—”\\n\\n“oh, tut, tut! i have no time! that left foot of yours with its inward\\ntwist is all over the place. a mole could trace it, and there it\\nvanishes among the reeds. oh, how simple it would all have been had i\\nbeen here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over\\nit. here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have\\ncovered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. but here are\\nthree separate tracks of the same feet.” he drew out a lens and lay\\ndown upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time\\nrather to himself than to us. “these are young mccarthy’s feet. twice\\nhe was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply\\nmarked and the heels hardly visible. that bears out his story. he ran\\nwhen he saw his father on the ground. then here are the father’s feet\\nas he paced up and down. what is this, then? it is the butt-end of the\\ngun as the son stood listening. and this? ha, ha! what have we here?\\ntiptoes! tiptoes! square, too, quite unusual boots! they come, they go,\\nthey come again—of course that was for the cloak. now where did they\\ncome from?” he ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the\\ntrack until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the\\nshadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. holmes\\ntraced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\\nhis face with a little cry of satisfaction. for a long time he remained\\nthere, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what\\nseemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens\\nnot only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could\\nreach. a jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he\\ncarefully examined and retained. then he followed a pathway through the\\nwood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.\\n\\n“it has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning\\nto his natural manner. “i fancy that this grey house on the right must\\nbe the lodge. i think that i will go in and have a word with moran, and\\nperhaps write a little note. having done that, we may drive back to our\\nluncheon. you may walk to the cab, and i shall be with you presently.”\\n\\nit was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into\\nross, holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up\\nin the wood.\\n\\n“this may interest you, lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “the\\nmurder was done with it.”\\n\\n“i see no marks.”\\n\\n“there are none.”\\n\\n“how do you know, then?”\\n\\n“the grass was growing under it. it had only lain there a few days.\\nthere was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. it corresponds\\nwith the injuries. there is no sign of any other weapon.”\\n\\n“and the murderer?”\\n\\n“is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes indian cigars, uses\\na cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. there are\\nseveral other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our\\nsearch.”\\n\\nlestrade laughed. “i am afraid that i am still a sceptic,” he said.\\n“theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\\nbritish jury.”\\n\\n“_nous verrons_,” answered holmes calmly. “you work your own method,\\nand i shall work mine. i shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\\nprobably return to london by the evening train.”\\n\\n“and leave your case unfinished?”\\n\\n“no, finished.”\\n\\n“but the mystery?”\\n\\n“it is solved.”\\n\\n“who was the criminal, then?”\\n\\n“the gentleman i describe.”\\n\\n“but who is he?”\\n\\n“surely it would not be difficult to find out. this is not such a\\npopulous neighbourhood.”\\n\\nlestrade shrugged his shoulders. “i am a practical man,” he said, “and\\ni really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a\\nleft-handed gentleman with a game leg. i should become the\\nlaughing-stock of scotland yard.”\\n\\n“all right,” said holmes quietly. “i have given you the chance. here\\nare your lodgings. good-bye. i shall drop you a line before i leave.”\\n\\nhaving left lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we\\nfound lunch upon the table. holmes was silent and buried in thought\\nwith a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a\\nperplexing position.\\n\\n“look here, watson,” he said when the cloth was cleared “just sit down\\nin this chair and let me preach to you for a little. i don’t know quite\\nwhat to do, and i should value your advice. light a cigar and let me\\nexpound.”\\n\\n “pray do so.”\\n\\n“well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\nmccarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\nimpressed me in his favour and you against him. one was the fact that\\nhis father should, according to his account, cry ‘cooee!’ before seeing\\nhim. the other was his singular dying reference to a rat. he mumbled\\nseveral words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s\\near. now from this double point our research must commence, and we will\\nbegin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”\\n\\n“what of this ‘cooee!’ then?”\\n\\n“well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. the son, as\\nfar as he knew, was in bristol. it was mere chance that he was within\\nearshot. the ‘cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever it\\nwas that he had the appointment with. but ‘cooee’ is a distinctly\\naustralian cry, and one which is used between australians. there is a\\nstrong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him\\nat boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia.”\\n\\n“what of the rat, then?”\\n\\nsherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it\\nout on the table. “this is a map of the colony of victoria,” he said.\\n“i wired to bristol for it last night.” he put his hand over part of\\nthe map. “what do you read?”\\n\\n“arat,” i read.\\n\\n“and now?” he raised his hand.\\n\\n“ballarat.”\\n\\n“quite so. that was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\ncaught the last two syllables. he was trying to utter the name of his\\nmurderer. so and so, of ballarat.”\\n\\n“it is wonderful!” i exclaimed.\\n\\n“it is obvious. and now, you see, i had narrowed the field down\\nconsiderably. the possession of a grey garment was a third point which,\\ngranting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. we have\\ncome now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an\\naustralian from ballarat with a grey cloak.”\\n\\n“certainly.”\\n\\n“and one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\nwander.”\\n\\n“quite so.”\\n\\n“then comes our expedition of to-day. by an examination of the ground i\\ngained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade, as\\nto the personality of the criminal.”\\n\\n“but how did you gain them?”\\n\\n“you know my method. it is founded upon the observation of trifles.”\\n\\n“his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\nstride. his boots, too, might be told from their traces.”\\n\\n“yes, they were peculiar boots.”\\n\\n“but his lameness?”\\n\\n“the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his\\nleft. he put less weight upon it. why? because he limped—he was lame.”\\n\\n“but his left-handedness.”\\n\\n“you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by\\nthe surgeon at the inquest. the blow was struck from immediately\\nbehind, and yet was upon the left side. now, how can that be unless it\\nwere by a left-handed man? he had stood behind that tree during the\\ninterview between the father and son. he had even smoked there. i found\\nthe ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables\\nme to pronounce as an indian cigar. i have, as you know, devoted some\\nattention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140\\ndifferent varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. having found\\nthe ash, i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\\nwhere he had tossed it. it was an indian cigar, of the variety which\\nare rolled in rotterdam.”\\n\\n“and the cigar-holder?”\\n\\n“i could see that the end had not been in his mouth. therefore he used\\na holder. the tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not\\na clean one, so i deduced a blunt pen-knife.”\\n\\n“holmes,” i said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he\\ncannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if\\nyou had cut the cord which was hanging him. i see the direction in\\nwhich all this points. the culprit is—”\\n\\n“mr. john turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our\\nsitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\\n\\nthe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. his slow,\\nlimping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,\\nand yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs\\nshowed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of\\ncharacter. his tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping\\neyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his\\nappearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the\\ncorners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. it was clear\\nto me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic\\ndisease.\\n\\n“pray sit down on the sofa,” said holmes gently. “you had my note?”\\n\\n“yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. you said that you wished to see\\nme here to avoid scandal.”\\n\\n“i thought people would talk if i went to the hall.”\\n\\n“and why did you wish to see me?” he looked across at my companion with\\ndespair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\\n\\n“yes,” said holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “it is\\nso. i know all about mccarthy.”\\n\\nthe old man sank his face in his hands. “god help me!” he cried. “but i\\nwould not have let the young man come to harm. i give you my word that\\ni would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes.”\\n\\n“i am glad to hear you say so,” said holmes gravely.\\n\\n“i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. it would\\nbreak her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that i am\\narrested.”\\n\\n“it may not come to that,” said holmes.\\n\\n“what?”\\n\\n“i am no official agent. i understand that it was your daughter who\\nrequired my presence here, and i am acting in her interests. young\\nmccarthy must be got off, however.”\\n\\n“i am a dying man,” said old turner. “i have had diabetes for years. my\\ndoctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month. yet i would\\nrather die under my own roof than in a gaol.”\\n\\nholmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a\\nbundle of paper before him. “just tell us the truth,” he said. “i shall\\njot down the facts. you will sign it, and watson here can witness it.\\nthen i could produce your confession at the last '"
